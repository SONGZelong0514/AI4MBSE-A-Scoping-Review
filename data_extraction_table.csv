Hassan F.U.; Nguyen T.; Le T.; Le C.,Automated prioritization of construction project requirements using machine learning and fuzzy Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA),2023,Automation in Construction,11,"Due to the emergence of risk-based verification practices, requirement prioritization has gained importance as a task in project requirements management. However, it is challenging due to the voluminous paper-based requirements, the reliance on manual content analysis and interviews, the limited focus on specific requirement types, and the neglect of the non-conformance detectability factor. This paper leverages historical data of risk priority numbers (RPN) for many written requirements to develop a novel machine learning model for requirement prioritization. The training data includes requirement statements manually annotated with professionals' ratings for three risk factors severity, probability, and non-detectability. The overall fuzzy RPN data was aggregated using fuzzy logic to tackle uncertainty in subjective ratings. The model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The study is anticipated to greatly aid professionals in prioritizing extensive textual project requirements essential for effective resource allocation that can eventually eliminate costly consequences of high-risk non-compliance. ? 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Construction contracts; Construction inspection; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Project requirements; Requirement prioritization,Computer circuits; Convolutional neural networks; Failure (mechanical); Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Project management; Construction contract; Construction inspection; Construction projects; Failure mode and effects analysis; Fuzzy-Logic; Machine-learning; Prioritization; Project requirement; Requirements prioritization; Risk-based; Machine learning,"T.

"Black J.E., Jr.",AI Assistance for Requirements Management,1994,Concurrent Engineering,0,"Extraction of requirements from customer specifications has long been a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone manual effort. This is further compounded by the tendency for requirements to be vague and fuzzy things which are difficult to manage. Hypermedia-based, Al-assisted requirements acquisition provides a significant competitive edge over traditional, labor-intensive, error-prone methods. SIR/REX (Systems Information Resource/Requirements EXtractor) provides automation and support to the earliest phases of systems engineering by placing customer specifications into an easily navigated, enriched information resource, and by automatically and consistently extracting candidate requirements and issues from specifications while creating links to the original source documentation. Requirements become tangible objects which can be easily reviewed, adjudicated, and managed by a human being; thus improving productivity and quality in requirements capture. Afterward, when new specifications or new versions of specifications are received, SIR/REX provides an intelligent change manager which facilitates impact analysis and change response while maximizing conservation of existing engineering investment. ? 1994, Sage Publications.

Eberlein A.P.-G.; Halsall F.,Telecommunications service development: A design methodology and its intelligent support,1997,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,6,"This paper describes a development life cycle for telecommunications services, emphasizing requirements capture, formal specification and validation. The service is developed along the three dimensions of the methodology: refinement, completeness and formality, aiming for a complete, consistent and formally specified service definition. The described methodology can be integrated into currently existing development life cycles which employ formal methods for service creation. Active support for the proposed life cycle is provided by a novel expert system called Requirements Assistant for Telecommunications Services (RATS), currently under development. It actively helps during requirements acquisition and early analysis, and encourages specification reuse with the help of a semi-automated negotiation process. The RATS tool advises the service developer during all stages of the service development, and on different levels of abstraction, and provides requirements management facilities, like traceability, impact analysis and document generation. Some of the features are illustrated using examples from the Universal Personal Telecommunication (UPT) service. ? 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

When we change one requirement it effects the other requirements of the system. A proper impact analysis maintains a repository of changing requirement, reusing previous experiences and reduces rework effort, is also essential for better requirement change management. There is also a need of a technique which improves requirement change management in a better way. In this paper, a model has been introduced which integrates Requirement Change Management and CBR (Case Based Reasoning) technique. Expert review method is used to evaluate our research. This frame work gives a better approach which manages requirement changes to the system. Our research outcome, i.e. the CBR technique used with the RCM, can provide a better approach to solve the issues of managing changes to the system.

Emebo O.; Olawande D.; Charles A.,An automated tool support for managing implicit requirements using Analogy-based Reasoning,2016,International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science,5,"Systems requirements are crucial to the proper functioning of a software and must be met for a project to be successful. Hence the need for its effective management. Implicit Requirements (IMRs) however are difficult to manage as a result of their nature-vague, unclear, and ambiguous amongst other characteristics. The process of requirement management is a continuous cycle as change in requirements and emergence of new requirements occur in a system. Hence the need for a tool/approach which identifies and manages requirements (implicit and explicit) effectively. However, most systems do not manage implicit requirements as a lot of attention is focused on explicit requirements. This research presents an approach for identification and management of IMRs using Analogy-based Reasoning in combination with two other core technologies (Ontology and Natural Language Processing). The approach is supported by a prototype tool, which was assessed by conducting a preliminary evaluation. The results indicate that the approach enables for early identification of IMRs when used with a good domain ontology and is potentially suitable for application in practice by experts. ? 2016 IEEE.",analogy-based reasoning; implicit requirement; NLP; ontology; requirements engineering,Information science; Ontology; Analogy-based reasoning; Automated tool support; Change in requirements; implicit requirement; NAtural language processing; Requirement engineering; Requirement management; Systems requirements; Natural language processing systems,"Department of computer and information sciences,  Covenant University,  Ota, Nigeria  ",IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,"Expert system (Analogy-based reasoning), NLP, Ontology",ES+NLP+Ontology,Requirement analysis and management,Software
Tikayat Ray A.; Cole B.F.; Pinon Fischer O.J.; Bhat A.P.; White R.T.; Mavris D.N.,Agile Methodology for the Standardization of Engineering Requirements Using Large Language Models,2023,Systems,8,"The increased complexity of modern systems is calling for an integrated and comprehensive approach to system design and development and, in particular, a shift toward Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches for system design. The requirements that serve as the foundation for these intricate systems are still primarily expressed in Natural Language (NL), which can contain ambiguities and inconsistencies and suffer from a lack of structure that hinders their direct translation into models. The colossal developments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in general, and Large Language Models (LLMs), in particular, can serve as an enabler for the conversion of NL requirements into machine-readable requirements. Doing so is expected to facilitate their standardization and use in a model-based environment. This paper discusses a two-fold strategy for converting NL requirements into machine-readable requirements using language models. The first approach involves creating a requirements table by extracting information from free-form NL requirements. The second approach consists of an agile methodology that facilitates the identification of boilerplate templates for different types of requirements based on observed linguistic patterns. For this study, three different LLMs are utilized. Two of these models are fine-tuned versions of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs), specifically, aeroBERT-NER and aeroBERT-Classifier, which are trained on annotated aerospace corpora. Another LLM, called flair/chunk-english, is utilized to identify sentence chunks present in NL requirements. All three language models are utilized together to achieve the standardization of requirements. The effectiveness of the methodologies is demonstrated through the semi-automated creation of boilerplates for requirements from Parts 23 and 25 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs). ? 2023 by the authors.",BERT; LLM; model-based systems engineering; NLP; requirement boilerplates; requirement tables; requirements engineering; transformer-based language models,\,"A.

Manual tracing numerous artifacts produced throughout the development process is error-prone and takes much time. To address these problems, we proposed a tool (Bonner, M.; Zeller, M.; Schulz, G.; Beyer, D.; Olteanu, M., 2023), which allows to establish links between requirements and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in a semi-automatic way. The underlying algorithms of our tool are embedding similarity computation and classification approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs). To assess the performance of underlying algorithm we propose an evaluation, where we compare the recall, the precision, and the F2 score of different approaches applied to our datasets. The goal of our evaluation is to understand how well LLMs perform in automatically generating trace links on different datasets. Our evaluation shows that it is worth to invest time in preprocessing the data and fine-tuning the LLMs to achieve the better recommendations for engineers, which improves the traceability process.",LLM; Requirements Engineering; MBSE; Semantic Web; Knowledge Graph,LLM; Requirement Engineering; MBSE; Semantic Web; Knowledge Graph,Siemens AG,INCOSE-International Council on Systems Engineering,Conference paper,Wiley,"LLM (MiniLM, MPNet)",LLM,Requirement analysis and management,Vehicle

Gr?Bler I.; PreuB D.; Brandt L.; Mohr M.,Efficient Extraction of Technical Requirements Applying Data Augmentation,2022,IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering,6,"Requirements for complex technical systems are documented in natural language sources. Manually extracting requirements from these documents-e.g., to transfer them to a requirements management tool-is time-consuming and error-prone. Today, machine learning approaches are used to classify natural language requirements and thus enable extraction of these requirements. However, in practice there is often not enough labeled domain-specific data available to train such models. For this reason, this work investigates the performance in artificially generating requirements through data augmentation. First, success criteria for a method for extracting and augmenting requirements are elicited in cooperation with industry experts. Second, the performance in the augmentation of requirements data is investigated. The results show that GPT-J is suitable for generating artificial requirements: weighted average F1-score: 62.74 %. Third, a method is developed to extract requirements from specifications, augment requirements data, and then classify the requirements. As a final step, the method is evaluated with requirements data from three industry case examples of the engineering service provider EDAG Engineering GmbH: Assembly latch hood, adjustable stopper hood and trunk curtain roller blind. Evaluation shows that especially the transferability of models is improved when they are trained with augmented data. The developed method facilitates eliciting complete requirements sets. Performance of artificial intelligence models in requirements extraction is improved applying augmented data and therefore the method leads to efficient product development.  ? 2022 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; data augmentation; machine learning; NLP; requirements engineering,Data mining; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Complex technical systems; Data augmentation; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Requirement engineering; Requirement management tools; Technical requirement; Requirements engineering,"I.

Peer J.; Mordecai Y.; Reich Y.,NLP4ReF: Requirements Classification and Forecasting: From Model-Based Design to Large Language Models,2024,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,0,"We introduce Natural Language Processing for Requirement Forecasting (NLP4ReF), a model-based machine learning and natural language processing solution for enhancing the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. RE continues to face significant challenges and demands innovative approaches for process efficiency. Traditional RE methods relying on natural language struggle with incomplete, hidden, forgotten, and evolving requirements during and after the critical design review, risking project failures and setbacks. NLP4ReF tackles several key challenges: a) distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements, b) classification of requirements by their respective system classes, and c) generation of unanticipated requirements to enhance project success. NLP4ReF employs a common natural language toolkit (NLTK) package and the recently-trending Chat-GPT. We tested NLP4ReF on PROMISE_exp, a pre-existing dataset with 1000 software requirements, and PROMISE_IoT, an enhanced dataset with 2000 software and IoT requirements. We validated NLP4ReF on a genuine IoT project. NLP4ReF swiftly generated dozens of new requirements, verified by a team of systems engineers, of which over 70% were crucial for project success. We found that GPT is superior in authentic requirement generation, while NLTK excels at requirement classification. NLP4ReF offers significant time saving, effort reduction, and improved future-proofing. Our model-based design approach provides a foundation for enhanced RE practices and future research in this domain. ? 2024 IEEE.",Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Model-Based Systems Engineering; NLP; Requirements Engineering; Requirement Forecasting,Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Software testing; Language processing; Machine-learning; Model-based system engineerings; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Project success; Requirement engineering; Requirement engineering requirement forecasting; Requirement forecasting; Requirements classifications; Requirements engineering,"J.

Yan W.; Chang D.; Huang Y.; Mi W.; Zhao N.,Soliciting customer requirements for product conceptualization based on laddering technique and ART2 neural network,2006,International Conference on Hybrid Information Technology,0,"With the increasing emphasis on customer demands by organizations, customer requirements management has secured a crucial position during the early stage of product conceptualization. However, it is still of scarcity to have a systematic strategy for soliciting customer requirements effectively. For this purpose, a customer-oriented approach has accordingly been proposed in this study. This prototype system is composed of two interrelated components, namely, the customer requirements elicitation (CRE) and customer/marketing analysis (CMA) modules. In the context of the prototype system, the laddering technique has been employed to enable the customer requirements elicitation via the so-called customer attributes hierarchy (CAH). In addition, the adaptive resonance theory (particularly ART2) neural network has also been applied as a toolkit for further customer and marketing analysis. A case study on mobile hand phone design is used as an example to validate and illustrate the prototype system. ? 2006 IEEE.",\,Customer satisfaction; Knowledge acquisition; Mobile phones; Neural networks; Customer attributes hierarchy (CAH); Customer requirements elicitation (CRE); Laddering technique; Product conceptualization; Product design,"W.

Perini A.; Susi A.; Avesani P.,A machine learning approach to software requirements prioritization,2013,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,131,"Deciding which, among a set of requirements, are to be considered first and in which order is a strategic process in software development. This task is commonly referred to as requirements prioritization. This paper describes a requirements prioritization method called Case-Based Ranking (CBRank), which combines project's stakeholders preferences with requirements ordering approximations computed through machine learning techniques, bringing promising advantages. First, the human effort to input preference information can be reduced, while preserving the accuracy of the final ranking estimates. Second, domain knowledge encoded as partial order relations defined over the requirement attributes can be exploited, thus supporting an adaptive elicitation process. The techniques CBRank rests on and the associated prioritization process are detailed. Empirical evaluations of properties of CBRank are performed on simulated data and compared with a state-of-the-art prioritization method, providing evidence of the method ability to support the management of the tradeoff between elicitation effort and ranking accuracy and to exploit domain knowledge. A case study on a real software project complements these experimental measurements. Finally, a positioning of CBRank with respect to state-of-the-art requirements prioritization methods is proposed, together with a discussion of benefits and limits of the method. ? 1976-2012 IEEE.",machine learning; Requirements management; requirements prioritization,Knowledge management; Requirements engineering; Experimental measurements; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Partial order relation; Preference information; Prioritization process; Requirements management; Requirements prioritization; Learning systems,"A.

The difficulty of manually creating it motivates investigation into alternatives to generate it automatically. This article presents two approaches to automatically creating the RTM using artificial intelligence techniques: RTM-Fuzzy, based on fuzzy logic and RTM-N, based on neural networks. They combine two other approaches, one based on functional requirements entry data (RTM-E) and the other based on natural language processing (RTM-NLP). The RTMs were evaluated through an experimental study and the approaches were improved using a genetic algorithm and a decision tree. On average, the approaches that used fuzzy logic and neural networks to combine RTM-E and RTM-NLP had better results compared with RTM-E and RTM-NLP singly. The results show that artificial intelligence techniques can enhance effectiveness for determining the requirement's traceability links.

Knauss E.; Ott D.,Semi- automatic categorization of natural language requirements,2014,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,12,"Context and motivation: Requirements of todays industry specifications need to be categorized for multiple reasons, including analysis of certain requirement types (like non-functional requirements) and identification of dependencies among requirements.This is a pre-requisite for effective communication and prioritization of requirements in industry-size specifications. Question/problem: Because of the size and complexity of these specifications, categorization tasks must be specifically supported in order to minimize manual efforts and to ensure a high classification accuracy. Approaches that make use of (supervised) automatic classification algorithms have to deal with the problem to provide enough training data with excellent quality. Principal ideas/results: In this paper, we discuss the requirements engineering team and their requirements management tool as a socio-technical system that allows consistent classification of requirements with a focus on organizational learning. We compare a manual, a semi-automatic, and a fully-automatic approach for the classification of requirements in this environment. We evaluate performance of these approaches by measuring effort and accuracy of automatic classification recommendations and combined performance of user and tool, and capturing the opinion of the expert-participants in a questionnaire. Our results show that a semiautomatic approach is most promising, as it offers the best ratio of quality and effort and the best learning performance.

Hein P.H.; Kames E.; Chen C.; Morkos B.,Reasoning support for predicting requirement change volatility using complex network metrics,2022,Journal of Engineering Design,10,"Due to inevitable design iterations, requirements are frequently changed and revised. If not effectively managed, undesired propagating changes may result in monetary and time losses, leading to project failure. Current requirement management tools lack formal reasoning for characterising change and its propagation. Based on prior research that suggests that requirement networks can be utilised to study change propagation and that requirement change volatility (RCV) can be measured through four classes: namely, multiplier, absorber, transmitter, and robust, which are defined based on how requirements behave to the initial change. This research investigates if complex network metrics can be used to predict RCV using computational methods. The RCV class metrics of each requirement are determined using industrial data and requirement relationships obtained from networks of a previously developed Refined Automated Requirement Change Propagation Prediction (R-ARCPP) tool. Complex network metrics are also computed for each requirement in the network. Regression analysis models, specifically ordinal output cumulative logit regression models employing information criterion based genetic algorithm model selection, and artificial neural network models, specifically backpropagation artificial neural networks, are employed to predict RCV using complex network metrics. Best performing models are discussed along with the limitations, conclusions, and future direction of this research. ? 2022 The Author(s).

Most methods rely on shallow language processing technologies for the automatic extraction of core concepts (e.g. components/devices, their parts and functionalities) and norms (e.g. constraints on the use of components). Few works have been devoted to study paraphrasing (i.e. textual equivalence between requirement definitions) for consistency checking and redundancy elimination. We propose here a distributional method to train a kernel-based learning algorithm (i.e. SVM), as a cost-effective approach to validate requirements from text in support of Requirement Analysis in the design of a Complex Systems, i.e. Naval Combat Systems. These latter are complex systems based on software components able to manage all the Combat System Equipment in different mission scenarios. We will describe the application of Recognition of Textual Entailment (RTE) techniques based on data-driven learning methods to this scenario. While modeling the asymmetric logical relation of entailment between two textual descriptions (i.e. an hypothesis and its thesis), RTE can be here applied to the validation step of compositions between system functionalities described in the requirement specification texts. Early evidences are here discussed, as a proof of the strong applicability of the method to the general case and to other realistic scenarios in System Engineering.",\,\,University of Rom,INCOSE-International Council on Systems Engineering,Conference paper,Wiley,"NLP, Machine learning (SVM)",ML+NLP,Requirement analysis and management,Other£¨Defense£©

However, PLM activities of the beginning-of-life and end-of-life of a product mainly deal with a fastidious document-based approach. Indeed, requirements are scattered in many different prescriptive documents (reports, specifications, standards, regulations, etc.) that make the feeding of a requirements management tool laborious. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract requirements from prescriptive documents. Second, we show how machine learning techniques can be used to develop a text classifier that will automatically classify requirements into disciplines. Both contributions support companies willing to feed a requirements management tool from prescriptive documents. The NLP experiment shows an average precision of 0.86 and an average recall of 0.95, whereas the SVM requirements classifier outperforms that of naive Bayes with a 76% accuracy rate.

Requirements are usually expressed partly or totally in a natural language (NL) format and come from different documents. Their qualities are difficult to analyze manually, especially when hundreds of thousands of them have to be considered. The assistance of software tools is becoming a necessity. In this article, the goal was to develop a set of metrics supported by NL processing (NLP) methods supporting different types of analysis of requirements and especially the dependencies between requirements. An NLP approach is used to extract requirements from text; to analyze their quality, links, similarities, and contradictions; and to cluster them automatically. The analysis framework includes different combinations of methods such as cosine similarity, singular value decomposition, and K-means clustering. One objective is to assess the possible combinations and their impacts on detections to establish optimal metrics. Three case studies exemplify and support the validation of the work. Graphs are used to represent the automatically clustered requirements, as well as similarities and contradictions. A new contradiction analysis process that includes a rules-based approach is proposed. Finally, the combined results are presented as graphs, which unveil the semantic relationships between requirements. Subsection 4.8 compares the results provided by the tool and the results obtained from experts. The proposed methodology and network presentation not only support the understanding of the semantics of the requirements but also help requirements engineers to review the interconnections and consistency of requirements systems and manage traceability. The approach is valuable during the early phases of projects when requirements are evolving dynamically and rapidly. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",contradictions analysis; network representation; requirements management; similarity,Natural language processing systems; Requirements engineering; Semantics; Contradiction analysis; Contradictions analysis; Graph representation; Network representation; Requirements management; Rules-based approaches; Semantic relationships; Similarity; Singular value decomposition,"E.

Lyutov A.; Uygun Y.; H¨¹tt M.-T.,Managing workflow of customer requirements using machine learning,2019,Computers in Industry,14,"Customer requirements ¨C product specifications issued by the customer ¨C organize the dialog between suppliers and customers and, hence, affect the dynamics of supply networks. These large and complex documents are frequently updated over time, while changes are seldom marked by the customers who issue the requirements. The lack of structure and defined responsibilities, thus, demands an expert to manually process the requirements. Here, the possibility to improve the usual workflow with machine learning algorithms is explored. The whole requirements management process has two major bottlenecks, which can be automatized. The first one, detecting changes, can be accomplished via a document comparison tool. The second one, recognizing the responsibilities and assigning them to the right department, can be solved with standard machine learning algorithms. Here, such algorithms are applied to a dataset obtained from a global automotive industry supplier. The proposed method improves the requirements management process by reducing an expert's workload and thus decreasing the time for processing one document was reduced from 2 weeks to 1 h. Moreover, the method gives a high accuracy of department assignment and can self-improve once implemented into a requirements management system. Although the machine learning methods are very popular nowadays, they are seldom used to improve business processes in real companies, especially in the case of processes that did not require digitalization in the past. Here we show, how such methods can solve some of the management problems and improve their workflow. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Automation; Classification; Documents management; Machine learning,Automation; Automotive industry; Classification (of information); Information retrieval systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Requirements engineering; Sales; Complex documents; Customer requirements; Machine learning methods; Management problems; Product specifications; Requirements management; Requirements management systems; Standard machines; Learning algorithms,"A.

Large projects may have tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of requirements to be managed and fulfilled. Two main issues impede requirements analysis: tortuous requirements to be interpreted; and humans¡¯ very limited ability to concentrate on a specific task. It has therefore been recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to support designers¡¯ decision making in classifying and allocating NPP requirements into predefined classes. This paper presents our work on developing an AI-based requirements classifier utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine-learning (ML). In addition, the paper presents the integration of the classifier with the requirements management system. The focus is on the classification of nuclear power industry-specific requirements utilizing deep-learning-based NLP. Three classifiers are compared, and the corresponding results are presented. The results include predetermined requirement classes, manually gathered and classified data, a comparison of three models and their classification accuracies, microservice system architecture, and integration of the established classifier with the requirements management system. As the performance of the requirements classifier and related system has been successfully demonstrated, future AI-specific development and studies are suggested to focus on atomizing multiclass requirements, combining similar requirements into one, checking requirements syntax, and utilizing unsupervised learning for clustering. Furthermore, new and advantageous requirement classes and hierarchies are suggested for development while improving current datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Koh S.-J.; Chua F.-F.,ReqGo: A Semi-Automated Requirements Management Tool,2023,International Journal of Technology,0,"This study deals with issues of changes in requirements management by dealing with requirements ambiguity and prioritization. A hypothesis about the possibility of integrating machine learning techniques and requirements management processes has been proven. It highlights the efforts in automating requirements ambiguity identification, requirements classification, and prioritization considering multi-criteria in decision-making through the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Universal Sentence Encoder. Na?ve Bayes (NB) classifier has been applied with its remarkable performance on binarily classifying requirements. Although existing methods proved to improve one or two of the process significantly, it rarely integrates the whole requirements management activity. The proposed tool helps the development team to manage the requirements systematically. The prioritization algorithm is proved to work as expected by considering multiple constraints before calculating the priority value. Meanwhile, it identifies the ambiguity that exists in the requirement automatically. The ambiguity classifier successfully identifies 87.5% of requirements accurately. Possible future work could be done in improving the prioritization module by allowing automated estimation of priority value upon requirements change.

Nikora A.P.; Balcom G.,Automated identification of LTL patterns in natural language requirements,2009,International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering,38,"Analyzing requirements for consistency and checking them for correctness can require significant effort, particularly if they have not been maintained with a requirements management tool (e.g., DOORS) or specified in a machine-readable notation. By restricting the number of requirements being analyzed, fewer opportunities exist for introducing errors into the analysis. This can be accomplished by subsetting the requirements and analyzing one subset at a time. Previous work showed that simple natural language processing and machine learning techniques can be used to identify temporal requirements within a set of natural language requirements. This paper builds on that work by detailing our results in applying these techniques to a set of natural-language temporal requirements taken from a current JPL mission and determining whether a requirement is one of the most frequently occurring types of temporal requirements. The ability to distinguish between different LTL patterns in natural-language requirements raises the possibility of automating the transformation of natural-language temporal requirements into LTL expressions. This would allow automated consistency checking and tracing of naturallanguage temporal requirements. Since correctness properties are often specified as LTL expressions, this would also provide a set of correctness properties against which abstract models of the system could be verified. ? 2009 IEEE.",Machine learning; NLP; Requirements analysis; Temporal requirements,Computational linguistics; Computer software selection and evaluation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quality assurance; Requirements engineering; Abstract models; Automated identification; Consistency checking; Correctness properties; Language requirements; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; NAtural language processing; Natural language requirements; Requirements analysis; Requirements management tool; Software reliability,"A.

The difficulty regarding to requirements traceability makes the system changes hard to be managed. Objective: This paper presents two approaches that allow the automated generation of the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM): the RTM-E approach, which is based on the requirement input data, and the RTM-NLP approach, which is based on Natural Language Processing-NLP. Method: The RTM-E comprises the requirements dependency related to the data manipulated by them, while the RTM-NLP comprises the requirements dependency related to the similarities of their functionality descriptions. The results are shown through visualization of information in order to facilitate the understanding of such dependencies. Results: We conducted an experimental study in which both approaches were applied to 18 requirements documents. The RTMs created automatically were compared with the reference RTM created manually based on the stakeholders knowledge. Comparing the generated matrices, it was seen that the RTM-E on average matches 82% to the reference RTM, while the RTM-NLP approach on average matches 53%. Conclusions: The results show that generating the RTM based on these approaches, the effectiveness on determining the requirements dependences is satisfactory and motivates to keep studying in order to make improvements for both approaches. ? 2012 IEEE.",Component: requirements traceability; Requirements management; Requirements traceability matrix,Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Visualization; Automated generation; Automatic Generation; Experimental studies; Input datas; Natural languages; Requirements document; Requirements management; Requirements traceability; Requirements traceability matrix; System change; System failures; Visualization of information; Requirements engineering,"A.

Due to the complexity of production development such as automotive, software industry and the aerospace industry, managing requirements is indispensable and challenging. Products in these industries are constantly being updated and modified as the understanding of risks increases with experience and new products are developed in light of such risk. Therefore, the traceability links among the requirements artifacts, which fulfill business objectives, is so critical to reducing the risk and ensuring the success of products. To that end, this paper propose a semantic based traceability link recovery (STLR) architecture.

Misra J.,Terminological inconsistency analysis of natural language requirements,2016,Information and Software Technology,10,"Context: Terminological inconsistencies owing to errors in usage of terms in requirements specifications could result into subtle yet critical problems in interpreting and applying these specifications into various phases of SDLC. Objective: In this paper, we consider special class of terminological inconsistencies arising from term-aliasing, wherein multiple terms spread across a corpus of natural language text requirements may be referring to the same entity. Identification of such alias entity-terms is a difficult problem for manual analysis as well as for developing tool support. Method: We consider the case of syntactic as well as semantic aliasing and propose a systematic approach for identifying these. Identification of syntactic aliasing involves automated generation of patterns for identifying syntactic variances of terms including abbreviations and introduced-aliases. Identification of semantic aliasing involves extracting multidimensional features (linguistic, statistical, and locational) from given requirement text to estimate semantic relatedness among terms. Based upon the estimated relatedness and standard language database based refinement, clusters of potential semantic aliases are generated. Results of these analyses with user refinement lead to generation of entity-term alias glossary and unification of term usage across requirements. Results: A prototype tool was developed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach for an automated analysis of term-aliasing in the requirements given as plain English language text. Experimental results suggest that approach is effective in identifying syntactic as well as semantic aliases, however, when aiming for higher recall on larger corpus, user selection is necessary to eliminate false positives. Conclusion: This proposed approach reduces the time-consuming and error-prone task of identifying multiple terms which might be referring to the same entity to a process of tool assisted identification of such term-aliases. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Business process model repositories, which may contain hundreds of models, are important sources of such cross-functional information. In this study, we introduce an approach which facilitates business process improvement by utilizing the comprehensive information covered by process models. Speci.cally, we associate requirements with other organizational entities based on their transitive relations with process models. To infer these associations, our approach makes use of natural language processing techniques and enterprise semantics.

Hajri I.; Goknil A.; Briand L.C.; Stephany T.,Configuring use case models in product families,2018,Software and Systems Modeling,17,"In many domains such as automotive and avionics, the size and complexity of software systems is quickly increasing. At the same time, many stakeholders tend to be involved in the development of such systems, which typically must also be configured for multiple customers with varying needs. Product Line Engineering (PLE) is therefore an inevitable practice for such systems. Furthermore, because in many areas requirements must be explicit and traceability to them is required by standards, use cases and domain models are common practice for requirements elicitation and analysis. In this paper, based on the above observations, we aim at supporting PLE in the context of use case-centric development. Therefore, we propose, apply, and assess a use case-driven configuration approach which interactively receives configuration decisions from the analysts to generate product-specific (PS) use case and domain models. Our approach provides the following: (1) a use case-centric product line modeling method (PUM), (2) automated, interactive configuration support based on PUM, and (3) an automatic generation of PS use case and domain models from Product Line (PL) models and configuration decisions. The approach is supported by a tool relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and integrated with an industrial requirements management tool, i.e., IBM DOORS. We successfully applied and evaluated our approach to an industrial case study in the automotive domain, thus showing evidence that the approach is practical and beneficial to capture variability at the appropriate level of granularity and to configure PS use case and domain models in industrial settings. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Configuration; Consistency checking; NLP; Product line engineering; Use case-driven development,Requirements engineering; Configuration; Configuration supports; Consistency checking; Industrial case study; Industrial requirements; Product line engineering; Requirements elicitation; Use-case; Natural language processing systems,"I.

Studies on software effort estimation often utilize expert knowledge to build statistical or machine learning models, although it is subjective and human-dependent. Rich text, natural language based descriptions provided by the customers are mostly not incorporated into the models during estimation. The aim of this study is to propose an early stage software effort estimation model that can predict the effort of the related problem immediately after a customer request or bug fix problem is appeared. Our model utilizes the textual descriptions of customer requests collected in the requirement management tool, and other features stored with the customer requests. Our results show that the use of textual data helps to make better predictions for an effort estimation system. Besides the effect of textual data, we asked whether there is a significant difference between the performance of an effort estimation system that can be used for all customers (Unified Model) and Customer Specific Models which is trained using only the related customer's requests. The Pred(25), Standard Accuracy (SA) and Gibbs' A were used during the evaluation. The Unified Model for early stage effort estimation achieves 43% pred(25) and 51% SA values. Customer Specific Models, on the other hand, depending on the customer, obtain 39%-58% Pred(25), and 35%-58% SA values. The results show that there is no significant advantage between the Unified Model and Customer Specific Models, and which model to use should be determined according to the customer. ? 2020 ACM.",Feature extraction; K-grams; Project management; Software effort estimation; Text mining,Object oriented programming; Software design; Effort Estimation; Expert knowledge; Machine learning models; Natural languages; Requirement management tools; Software development effort; Software effort estimation; Textual description; Sales,"Istanbul Technical University Istanbul, Turkey£¬tosunay@itu.edu.tr",Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,NLP,NLP,Requirement analysis and management,Software
Lebeaupin B.; Rauzy A.,Toward a better integration of requirements and model-based specifications,2020,Systems Engineering,4,"As of today, most specifications of technical systems still rely on requirements written in natural language. However, this approach is known to be problem-prone, due to the inherent ambiguity of natural languages. On the other hand, fully formal or model-based approaches seem to be out of reach in many practical cases, especially in early design phases of systems. In this article, we study how to combine in a pragmatic way natural language requirements with models. We propose to keep both formats and to link pieces of text in requirements with elements of models. In other words, corpuses of requirements are managed as hypertexts with links to models. For this approach to be fully efficient, the text of requirements is not free, but relies on controlled natural language techniques leading to a partial structuring of the text. We show that this makes it possible to design (semi)automatic verifications on requirements and models, which would be impossible with unconstrained natural language.

It provides structures and processes for the efficient processing of requirements by fostering the collaboration between different engineering disciplines and enabling early validation of the product.

Tikayat Ray A.; Cole B.F.; Pinon Fischer O.J.; White R.T.; Mavris D.N.,aeroBERT-Classifier: Classification of Aerospace Requirements Using BERT,2023,Aerospace,24,"The system complexity that characterizes current systems warrants an integrated and comprehensive approach to system design and development. This need has brought about a paradigm shift towards Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches to system design and a departure from traditional document-centric methods. While MBSE shows great promise, the ambiguities and inconsistencies present in Natural Language (NL) requirements hinder their conversion to models directly. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has demonstrated great potential in facilitating the conversion of NL requirements into a semi-machine-readable format that enables their standardization and use in a model-based environment. A first step towards standardizing requirements consists of classifying them according to the type (design, functional, performance, etc.) they represent. To that end, a language model capable of classifying requirements needs to be fine-tuned on labeled aerospace requirements. This paper presents an open-source, annotated aerospace requirements corpus (the first of its kind) developed for the purpose of this effort that includes three types of requirements, namely design, functional, and performance requirements. This paper further describes the use of the aforementioned corpus to fine-tune BERT to obtain the aeroBERT-Classifier: a new language model for classifying aerospace requirements into design, functional, or performance requirements. Finally, this paper provides a comparison between aeroBERT-Classifier and other text classification models such as GPT-2, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and bart-large-mnli. In particular, it shows the superior performance of aeroBERT-Classifier on classifying aerospace requirements over existing models, and this is despite the fact that the model was fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. ? 2023 by the authors.",BERT; NLP; requirements classification; requirements engineering; text classification,\,"A.

Ray A.T.; Fischer O.J.; Mavris D.N.; White R.T.; Cole B.F.,aeroBERT-NER: Named-Entity Recognition for Aerospace Requirements Engineering using BERT,2023,AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition,16,"Organizations predominantly use natural language (NL) for requirements elicitation, development, and management since NL is easy to understand and use by stakeholders with varying levels of experience, unlike specialized model-based languages, which require training to use. However, NL requirements entail ambiguities associated with language, a tedious and errorprone manual examination process, difficulties verifying requirement completeness, and failure to recognize and use technical terms effectively. Modern complex systems warrant an integrated and holistic approach to their development to capture their numerous interrelationships. This need has spurred a trend toward model-centric approaches to engineering as compared to traditional document-based methods. Transitioning to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) requires standardized, machine-readable requirements, but the conversion of NL requirements into models is hindered by the ambiguities and inconsistencies inherent in NL. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has shown promise in facilitating the conversion of NL requirements into a format that enables their standardization and use in a model-based environment. Named-Entities Recognition (NER), in particular, can be leveraged to help address the ambiguities in NL requirements. To be of value, however, a language model needs to be fine-tuned to recognize aerospace-specific terms. To that end, we developed an annotated aerospace corpus and fine-tuned the BERT language model on the corpus to create aeroBERT-NER: a new model for identifying named entities (NEs) in aerospace requirements. A comparison between aeroBERT-NER and BERTBASE-NER showed the improved performance of aeroBERT-NER in identifying NEs within a set of aerospace requirements. The NEs identified by the model were used to create a glossary to facilitate consistent use of technical terms and language in aerospace requirements. ? 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Peng T.; She K.; Shen Y.; Xu X.; Yu Y.,Enhancing Traceability Link Recovery with Fine-Grained Query Expansion Analysis,2023,Information,1,"Requirement traceability links are an essential part of requirement management software and are a basic prerequisite for software artifact changes. The manual establishment of requirement traceability links is time-consuming. When faced with large projects, requirement managers spend a lot of time in establishing relationships from numerous requirements and codes. However, existing techniques for automatic requirement traceability link recovery are limited by the semantic disparity between natural language and programming language, resulting in many methods being less accurate. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained requirement-code traceability link recovery approach based on query expansion, which analyzes the semantic similarity between requirements and codes from a fine-grained perspective, and uses a query expansion technique to establish valid links that deviate from the query, so as to further improve the accuracy of traceability link recovery. Experiments showed that the approach proposed in this paper outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised traceability link recovery methods, not only specifying the obvious advantages of fine-grained structure analysis for word embedding-based traceability link recovery, but also improving the accuracy of establishing requirement traceability links.

For improved requirement management, it is recommended to identify and allocate project requirements at an early stage prior to construction for appropriate project progress monitoring and control with little effort and cost. Current requirement allocation practices rely heavily on time-consuming and error-prone manual processes due to a sheer volume of free-formatted project documents and the necessity of practitioners' judgment based on their experience and expertise. This paper aims to propose a systematic approach to assigning and clarifying project requirements to appropriate project parties. The proposed approach employs natural language processing (NLP) technique to automatically assign project requirements to responsible project parties. The allocated requirements are then incorporated into project geographical information system to present associated project requirements along with geo-spatial information. By integrating the information system with classified project requirements through NLP techniques, pro-active requirement allocation will further facilitate both managing of a variety of requirements and the real-time dissemination of them to all project parties. ? 2024 ASCE.",\,Information use; Natural language processing systems; Project management; Information systems integration; Language processing; Language processing techniques; Management IS; Natural languages; Planning and execution; Project execution; Project informations; Project planning; Requirement management; Information systems,"J.

Mullis J.; Chen C.; Morkos B.; Ferguson S.,Deep Neural Networks in Natural Language Processing for Classifying Requirements by Origin and Functionality: An Application of BERT in System Requirements,2024,Journal of Mechanical Design,4,"Given the foundational role of system requirements in design projects, designers can benefit from classifying, comparing, and observing connections between requirements. Manually undertaking these processes, however, can be laborious and time-consuming. Previous studies have employed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) deep neural network model, to automatically analyze written requirements. Yet, it remains unclear whether BERT can sufficiently capture the nuances that differentiate requirements between and within design documents. This work evaluates BERT's performance on two requirement classification tasks (one inter- document and one intra-document) executed on a corpus of 1,303 requirements sourced from five system design projects. First, in the ""parent document classification""task, a BERT model is fine-tuned to classify requirements according to their originating project. A separate BERT model is then fine-tuned on a ""functional classification""task where each requirement is classified as either functional or nonfunctional. Our results also include a comparison with a baseline model, Word2Vec, and demonstrate that our model achieves higher classification accuracy. When evaluated on test sets, the former model receives a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.95, while the latter receives an MCC of 0.82, indicating BERT's ability to reliably distinguish requirements. This work then explores the application of BERT's representations, known as embeddings, to identify similar requirements and predict requirement change.  ? 2023 by ASME.",BERT; design automation; NLP; requirements classification; requirements management,Computer aided design; Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Neural network models; Requirements engineering; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Classification tasks; Design automations; Design programs; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Requirement management; Requirements classifications; System requirements; Deep neural networks,"B.

J¨²nior F.S.; Reis P.A.; Cavalcante M.S.; De Oliveira A.H.M.,Systems Engineering Process Enhancement: Requirements Verification Methodology using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Automotive Industry,2024,SAE Technical Papers,0,"More sophisticated vehicle features to improve user experience and safety in the Automotive Industry applications have significantly increased the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) over the years. These changes were followed by the increased complexity in technical solutions for Embedded Software and interfaces among the ECUs. In this context, Systems Engineering (SE) plays a key role to achieve robustness on definition and implementation of complex systems. The overall system is broken down into lower functions associated to a specific use case, considering user's input and the expected outputs, in three different abstraction levels - Concept, Logic and Technology. Those functions are described with structure and behavior diagrams and requirements using SysML (Systems Modelling Language), which enables the entire system simulation and validation before being cascaded to ECUs Software implementation team during the Product Development process through Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools. On this scope, the requirements have a vital role inside Systems Engineering methodology because it is the statement which defines the system required functionalities, performance, constraints, and other characteristics that satisfy stakeholders and costumers needs. The SysML diagrams are built based on the defined system requirements and many times this is a very iterative process, time-consuming and error-prone task until satisfying every required function logic and conditions. When the requirements are poorly defined, these can lead to project failure. Therefore, requirements must be unambiguous, verifiable, and traceable through Systems Engineering lifecycle. By using Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) template, Systems Engineers have specific words to standardize the requirements, accomplishing with EARS requests such as ""When,""""While,""""Where,""""If""to mention the stimulus or pre-conditions, ""Then""to call the function/product and ""shall""representing the action to be taken. In addition, by using the rules proposed by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), Systems Engineers can improve the robustness of the requirement by avoiding, for example, words that may be misinterpreted during the system modeling and development process. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to improve process flow by automating requirement verification. NLP techniques will be responsible for mapping and processing the text data in the system requirements based on actions, preconditions, functions, and triggers to improve the quality and robustness of the developed requirements. By Applying NLP algorithms, this paper aims to consolidate a more robust methodology to verify the system requirements, based on EARS template and INCOSE rules, prior to SysML diagrams development, which improves the final overall system implementation to satisfy the stakeholders and customer needs.  ? 2021 SAE International.",\,Automotive industry; Computer circuits; Computer software; Control systems; Data handling; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Requirements engineering; Condition; Electronics control unit; Language processing; Natural languages; Process enhancements; Requirement verifications; System engineering process; System engineers; System models; System requirements; Modeling languages,Ford Motor Company Brazil,SAE International,Conference paper,Scopus,NLP,NLP,Requirement analysis and management,Vehicle
Kravari K.; Antoniou C.; Bassiliades N.,Sense: A flow-down semantics-based requirements engineering framework,2021,Algorithms,2,"The processes involved in requirements engineering are some of the most, if not the most, important steps in systems development. The need for well-defined requirements remains a critical issue for the development of any system. Describing the structure and behavior of a system could be proven vague, leading to uncertainties, restrictions, or improper functioning of the system that would be hard to fix later. In this context, this article proposes SENSE, a framework based on standardized expressions of natural language with well-defined semantics, called boilerplates, that support a flow-down procedure for requirement management. This framework integrates sets of boilerplates and proposes the most appropriate of them, depending, among other considerations, on the type of requirement and the developing system, while providing validity and completeness verification checks using the minimum consistent set of formalities and languages. SENSE is a consistent and easily understood framework that allows engineers to use formal languages and semantics rather than the traditional natural languages and machine learning techniques, optimizing the requirement development. The main aim of SENSE is to provide a complete process of the production and standardization of the requirements by using semantics, ontologies, and appropriate NLP techniques. Furthermore, SENSE performs the necessary verifications by using SPARQL (SPIN) queries to support requirement management. ? 2021 by the authors.

Bonner M.; Zeller M.; Schulz G.; Beyer D.; Olteanu M.,Automated Traceability between Requirements and Model-Based Design,2023,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,1,"Traceability is an important aspect in system development, since it helps to ensure that the developed system fulfills all requirements and prevents failures. When developing safety-critical systems, traceability is mandatory to demonstrate that the system is implemented correctly. Unfortunately, establishment and maintenance of trace links are hard to achieve manually in today¡¯s complex systems. Tools and methods for automated trace link generation, which have been proposed so far, have no broad adoption in industry and there is lack of evidence of their effectiveness. To address these challenges we introduce a tool, which allows establishing bi-directional traceability links between requirements and model-based designs using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our tool is an extension of the Siemens toolchain for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), systems engineering, and embedded software design. It creates trace links between requirements written in natural language and CapitalTM software, AUTOSAR, SysML, UML, or Arcadia models for system/software design.

Hassan F.U.; Le T.,Ontology-Based Approach to Risk-Factor Identification to Support the Management of Provisions in Bridge Design,2023,Journal of Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution in Engineering and Construction,1,"Requirement management is crucial in the design stage of infrastructure project delivery to ensure the designed facility satisfies the owner expectations and avoids any costly redesign, rework, and disputes. The requirements are primarily described in design codes and standards. The relevant requirements from codes are transformed into a set of in computer-readable rules required for computer-aided design and compliance verification. Prior to the construction of rules, the requirements in codes must be converted into an organized, structured format in terms of risks to support easy retrieval of the relevant applicable requirements. However, the unavailability of risk information in the requirement text makes it challenging for a designer to extract the relevant requirements of specific risks to support design tasks, including compliance checking. The manual process of requirement classification according to risk factors is time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone because the codes are mostly voluminous, including thousands of specifications. Much less attention has been paid to develop an automated framework to organize the requirements in terms of risks addressed in them. To address this need, this study has attempted to develop an ontology-based framework to identify relevant risk factors addressed in bridge design requirements to support requirement management. The nine risk factors of bridge engineering used in this study included flood, earthquake, fire, snowfall, wind, temperature, overloading, vessel collision, and blast loading. A risk ontology was developed to represent the conceptualized semantic knowledge associated with each of the nine risk factors. The algorithm was validated on a human-annotated requirement dataset based on the AASHTO bridge design specifications and state design manuals. The developed model yielded a Spearman, Kendall tau, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.7223, 0.6021, and 0.7222, respectively. The proposed model is expected to improve specifications retrieval for rules construction, thereby enabling ease of requirement classification for the design process.  ? 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Bridge design; Deep learning; Design codes; NLP; Ontology; Requirements; Text classification; Text mining,Classification (of information); Compliance control; Computer aided design; Correlation methods; Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Risks; Semantics; Specifications; Text processing; Bridge design; Deep learning; Design codes; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology's; Requirement; Text classification; Text-mining; Ontology,"F.U.

A system's architecture is a crucial portion of the technical baseline that engineers and decision-makers alike will continuously develop, maintain, and reason over during the lifetime of any system. This paper presents a new tool, ArchEx, that lowers the barrier-to-entry for those looking to transition beyond these static architecture images. Using a combination of Python-based computer vision techniques, ArchEx allows for the intelligent, automated import of virtual paper-based architecture artifacts into commercial tools to allow for digital model representation and manipulation. It parses the architecture image to derive a graph structure which is then loaded into a model-based systems engineering tool. ArchEx provides an automated assist to the systems engineer, decreasing the time and effort typically required to transcribe image-based documentation into a modeling tool. It is being actively developed within the MITRE Corporation, with initial test applications and experimentation showing promising results.

Lopez J.A.H.; Cuadrado J.S.,Generating Structurally Realistic Models With Deep Autoregressive Networks,2023,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,5,"Model generators are important tools in model-based systems engineering to automate the creation of software models for tasks like testing and benchmarking. Previous works have established four properties that a generator should satisfy: consistency, diversity, scalability, and structural realism. Although several generators have been proposed, none of them is focused on realism. As a result, automatically generated models are typically simple and appear synthetic. This work proposes a new architecture for model generators which is specifically designed to be structurally realistic. Given a dataset consisting of several models deemed as real models, this type of generators is able to produce new models which are structurally similar to the models in the dataset, but are fundamentally novel models. Our implementation, named ModelMime (M2), is based on a deep autoregressive model which combines a Graph Neural Network with a Recurrent Neural Network. We decompose each model into a sequence of edit operations, and the neural network is trained in the task of predicting the next edit operation given a partial model. At inference time, the system produces new models by sampling edit operations and iteratively completing the model. We have evaluated M2 with respect to three state-of-the-art generators, showing that 1) our generator outperforms the others in terms of the structurally realistic property 2) the models generated by M2 are most of the time consistent, 3) the diversity of the generated models is at least the same as the real ones and, 4) the generation process is scalable once the generator is trained.  ? 1976-2012 IEEE.",generative models; graph neural networks; Model generators; realistic models; recurrent neural networks,Job analysis; Object oriented programming; Recurrent neural networks; Software testing; Computational modelling; Generative model; Generator; Graph neural networks; Model generator; Object oriented modelling; Predictive models; Property; Realistic model; Task analysis; Scalability,"J.A.H.

Madni A.M.; Purohit S.,"Augmenting MBSE with Digital Twin Technology: Implementation, Analysis, Preliminary Results, and Findings",2021,"IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",7,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) requires more significant investment than traditional systems engineering in the early system life cycle phases. Program management justifies this additional investment by arguing that such investments can be expected to produce continuous gains across later phases of the systems life cycle resulting from early detection of defects, risk reduction, improved communication, superior supply chain integration, product line definition, and enhanced traceability. Since systems continue to evolve over their life cycle, system models need to be updated continually to reflect the system's current state and thereby sustain value. However, in today's systems engineering organizations, the current practice is to reallocate modeling resources to other projects once initial modeling on a particular project is completed. This practice results in a resource shortfall that impedes the ability to continuously update system models through the later phases of the system life cycle. This paper presents how digital twin technology can be exploited within MBSE to ensure continuous model updates throughout the system life cycle. This paper also presents preliminary results from prototyping and experiments conducted with a digital twin that is continuously updated with data from the physical system operating in the real world. Finally, this paper shows how operational analysis and system modeling can be significantly enhanced by leveraging digital twin technology within MBSE.  ? 2021 IEEE.",\,Investments; Life cycle; Supply chains; Continuous gains; Detection of defects; Implementation analysis; Model-based system engineerings; Program management; Risks reduction; System life cycle; System models; Technology implementation; Traditional systems; Systems engineering,"Azad M.

Zhang Q.; Liu J.; Li L.; Chen X.; Wang R.,Automatic generation of system model diagrams driven by multi-source heterogeneous data,2024,Journal of Engineering Design,0,"The demand for functionality, performance, safety, and reliability in complex product domains is continuously increasing, leading to growing product complexity. Traditional document-based systems engineering approaches face numerous challenges in terms of communication efficiency, traceability, and maintenance when dealing with complex product system design. Consequently, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been widely adopted. To improve the efficiency of system modelling, an effective method is needed to automate the process by reusing existing design resources. This study proposes a knowledge graph-based approach for the automatic generation of system model diagrams, consisting of three main steps. Firstly, a system model graph is constructed using an existing system model repository. Then, the required modelling elements are extracted from design documents, and reusable model elements are obtained based on the system model graph. Lastly, a mapping relationship is established between system model elements extracted from multi-source heterogeneous data and SysML metamodel, enabling the automatic generation of system model diagrams based on SysML views. This approach effectively leverages the information from the existing system model repository and achieves automated mapping conversion from multi-source heterogeneous data to the SysML system model.

Fuchs J.; Helmerich C.; Holland S.,Transforming System Modeling with Declarative Methods and Generative AI,2024,AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition,0,"The advancement of fully digital engineering methods hinges on the widespread adoption of model-based system engineering (MBSE) processes, which are essential for effectively managing the escalating complexity of projects. A pivotal aspect of MBSE lies in the creation and utilization of detailed system models that digitally encapsulate project information. However, the current bottleneck in digital engineering primarily stems from the task of model creation. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) in automating the model creation process within a novel declarative framework. Here, users engage with the system by expressing information or instructions in natural language, presenting a paradigm shift in how models can be created. The paper also presents the tangible impacts of incorporating LLMs on both cost and time factors associated with object creation, content review, and artifact creation. Real-world examples of LLM interactions are provided, offering concrete references to underscore the practical applicability and efficacy of this innovative approach with some tasks seeing a 10x-15x improvement in speed and cost.

To explore this, we tasked a group of systems engineers to each create a list of requirements and use case diagram to satisfy a systems of systems user scenario presented in a proposal document. Participants created models of a healthcare setting in which clinicians resolved discrepancies with patient care by consulting additional sources of record, demonstrating the importance of integrating new systems within the larger healthcare system of systems. The first group were provided open access to an LLM, the second group were provided draft materials generated by an LLM, and the third followed their normal workflow. A subject matter expert (SME) evaluator then scored each model according to its completeness, consistency, correctness, simplicity, and traceability. Through this, we show that although LLMs are not a replacement for a trained systems engineer, they can contribute in two primary ways to the modeling process: first, they can generate a significant portion of the information necessary to create a minimum viable product (MVP) model within a fraction of the time, offering a promising way to accelerate the overall model development process. Second, they can answer detailed, domain-specific questions and reduce the time spent on external research. ? 2024 IEEE.",generative AI; LLM; model-based systems engineering; modeling,System of systems; Artificial intelligence tools; Generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Large language model; Model use; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling; System engineers; System-of-systems; Traditional systems; Artificial intelligence,"E.S.

The approach can customize the GPT-4 model with an activity metamodel specified in Eclipse Ecore or predefined activity diagrams encoded in a textual format for learning from instances. Alternatively, the descriptive text from the LLM can be provided as input to a parser, resulting in an activity that can be readily transformed into a discrete event system specification (DEVS) model with simulation capability. We will discuss how the process can be enhanced in a simulation environment, thus offering the opportunity to examine a variety of scenarios and arguments for incorporating generative AI or general AI as a collaborative agent in the domain of interest.

Saini R.,Artificial intelligence empowered domain modelling bot,2020,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,7,"With the increasing adoption of Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) to handle the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers.

Nejati S.; Sabetzadeh M.; Arora C.; Briand L.C.; Mandoux F.,Automated change impact analysis between SysML models of requirements and design,2016,ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,28,"An important activity in systems engineering is analyzing how a change in requirements will impact the design of a system. Performing this analysis manually is expensive, particularly for complex systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically identify the impact of requirements changes on system design, when the requirements and design elements are expressed using models. We ground our approach on the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) due to SysML's increasing use in industrial applications. Our approach has two steps: For a given change, we first apply a static slicing algorithm to extract an estimated set of impacted model elements. Next, we rank the elements of the resulting set according to a quantitative measure designed to predict how likely it is for each element to be impacted. The measure is computed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to the textual content of the elements. Engineers can then inspect the ranked list of elements and identify those that are actually impacted. We evaluate our approach on an industrial case study with 16 real-world requirements changes. Our results suggest that, using our approach, engineers need to inspect on average only 4.8% of the entire design in order to identify the actually-impacted elements. We further show that our results consistently improve when our analysis takes into account both structural and behavioral diagrams rather than only structural ones, and the natural-language content of the diagrams in addition to only their structural and behavioral content. ? 2016 ACM.",Change Impact Analysis; Model Slicing; NLP; SysML; Traceability Information Model,Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Change impact analysis; Model slicing; NAtural language processing; SysML; Traceability information; Structural analysis,"Delphi Automotive, Luxembourg felix.mandoux@delphi.com",Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,NLP,NLP,System modeling,Industry
Ballard M.; Peak R.; Cimtalay S.; Mavris D.,Bidirectional Text-to-Model Element Requirement Transformation,2020,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,6,"Elicitation, representation, and analysis of requirements are important tasks performed early in the systems engineering process. This remains true with the adoption of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodologies. Existing SysML-based methodologies often choose between (i) using external requirements documents and/or databases as the authoritative source for requirements truth versus (ii) generating requirements directly, as elements in the system model. In either case, there is often need for the systems engineer to manually develop a model-based requirements representation, as this faculty is not automatic in the commonly-used SysML feature set. Additionally, once the system model has been completed, systems engineers typically must prepare traditional 'shall-statement' requirements for external review purposes, as not all stakeholders can be expected to be trained in system model interpretation. This paper details a novel effort to address both problems, by automatically transforming text-based requirements (TBR) into SysML model-based requirement (MBR) representations, and vice versa. The text-to-model based transformation direction uses requirement templates and natural language processing techniques, expanding on work from the field of requirements engineering. This paper also presents an aerospace-domain case study application of the developed tool. In the case study, a selected set of requirements were analyzed, and a system model was constructed. Then, the intermediate output system model was updated with additional elements, to represent the progression of the project's systems engineering process. The modified system model was then analyzed, constructing text-based requirements from the structure. The resulting text-based requirements were compared to the initial set of input requirements to assess consistency in both directions of analysis. The methodology developed in this paper improves the systems engineering process by saving the systems engineer time constructing potentially repetitive model elements, and by enabling model-based requirement analyses to methodologies previously only capable of processing text-based requirements. Further, the methodology eases the responsibility of the systems engineer to maintain a copy of the model-based requirements in text-based format. ? 2020 IEEE.",\,Engineers; Natural language processing systems; Systems engineering; Aerospace domain; Model based transformations; Model-based requirements; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); NAtural language processing; Requirements document; System modeling; Systems engineering process; Engineering education,"Georgia Institute of Technology 270 Ferst Drive NW Atlanta, GA 30332-0150",IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,NLP,NLP,System modeling,Aerospace£¨UAV£©

And SysML, as a common modelling language for MBSE practitioners, has many irreplaceable advantages. Requirements diagrams are the primary medium of SysML for conveying traceability between requirements and from requirements to structure and behaviour in a system model. Today, how to automate the construction of SysML requirements models is a significant challenge. This paper proposes an automatic SysML model generation method based on Chinese free-text requirements using natural language processing.

The primary step in automating the evaluation is in the representation of the system or systems of systems, which can be achieved in a systems modeling language. One such systems modeling language is SysML, which allows users to model a wide variety of diagram types for structural and behavioral representation. SysML leverages the Object Management Group XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) to exchange modeling data between tools. These languages can be interchanged into XMI; however, the XMI generated in modeling environments contains irrelevant information that can be refined using an algorithmic approach. Extracting these redundancies is essential to building a knowledge base of the vital components needed to replicate these XMI files outside the modeling environment using NLP strategies. Towards that end, we present XMLSlim, a robust and persistent algorithm that optimizes XML files by modifying elements and attributes without altering their meaning. By implementing XMLSlim on aerospace and electromechanical use cases, we illustrated the effectiveness of our approach with a 60% reduction in the file size while preserving their semantic meaning.

As such, the typical pitfalls of activities involving the human factor often manifest themselves in terms of lack of completeness or exhaustiveness of the analysis, inconsistencies across design choices or documentation, as well as an implicit degree of subjectivity. An approach is proposed to assist systems engineers in the automatic generation of systems diagrams from unstructured natural language text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract entities and their relationships from textual resources (e.g., specifications, manuals, technical reports, maintenance reports) available within an organisation, and convert them into Systems Modelling Language (SysML) diagrams, with particular focus on structure and requirement diagrams. The intention is to provide the users with a more standardised, comprehensive and automated starting point onto which subsequently refine and adapt the diagrams according to their needs. The proposed approach is flexible and open-domain. It consists of six steps which leverage open-access tools, and it leads to an automatic generation of SysML diagrams without intermediate modelling requirement, but through the specification of a set of parameters by the user.

Zhang J.; Yang S.,Recommendations for the Model-Based Systems Engineering Modeling Process Based on the SysML Model and Domain Knowledge,2024,Applied Sciences,0,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a modeling approach used in industry to support the formalization, analysis, design, checking and verification of systems. In MBSE modeling, domain knowledge is the basis of the modeling. However, modeling does not happen overnight; it requires systematic training and a significant investment of resources. Unfortunately, many domain experts lack the expertise required for modeling, even though they know the domain well. The question arises about how to provide system modelers with domain knowledge at the right time to support the efficient completion of modeling. Since MBSE research that integrates AI is just beginning to take off, no public dataset is available. In this paper, aerospace SysML models are constructed based on spacecraft-related domain knowledge to form SysML model data. The validation rules are studied to validate the SysML model data, and combined with the concept of the recommended system, a recommendation method for the MBSE modeling process based on the knowledge and SysML model is proposed. A GLOVE language model is pre-trained by using domain knowledge and general knowledge; the model data are also used to fine-tune the GLOVE language model combined with the pre-training to recommend some domain development processes. The recommendation list is manually quality-verified and fed into the pre-training phase, while new requirement texts are continuously added in the fine-tuning phase, resulting in a more relevant and accurate recommendation list.

Madni A.M.; Nance M.; Richey M.; Hubbard W.; Hanneman L.,Toward an experiential design language: Augmenting Model-Based Systems Engineering with technical storytelling in virtual worlds,2014,Procedia Computer Science,19,"Systems engineering has made significant strides over the last decade with the advent of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and the Systems Engineering Markup Language (SysML). These advances have made it possible for collaborative engineering teams to communicate using a common language and share information in the form of digital models rather than hard-to-maintain paper documents. One major advance that needs to occur next is enhancing systems engineering languages to address the needs of all stakeholders especially non-engineers. In this paper, we advance the proposition that recent advances in systems modeling, virtual world building, and technical storytelling are the key enablers of next generation systems engineering and systems engineering languages. To this end, this paper presents an innovative approach for developing an experiential design language that augments existing systems engineering language (i.e., SysML) with new perspectives informed by exploration and storytelling in virtual worlds. This language is intended to allow all stakeholders to understand and collaborate on system designs without having to learn engineering notation, and bring to bear their unique perspectives during collaborative system design. Furthermore, immersive experiences made possible by storytelling in the virtual world can potentially illuminate key system interactions and behaviors, allowing all stakholders to make meaningful contibuions in upfront systems engineering. The benefits an payofs of the experimental design language are increased participation of all stakeholders in upfront systems engineering; supeior collaboration among stakeholders by allowing them to focus on different system levels and perspectives; and elegent system design by getting the architecture right the first time minimum structural complexity. ? 2014 The Authors.

Pinqui¨¦ R.; Wang H.; Noel F.,Human-Centric Co-Design of Model-Based System Architecture,2023,Procedia CIRP,1,"Model-Based Systems Engineers, particularly those moving from software to systems engineering, claim that SysML-like notations, which are symbolic two-dimensional diagrams made of boxes and lines, are domain-independent, thus very convenient to support the cross-functional design of a system architecture. However, the abstract diagramming syntax of MBSE notations makes their adoption difficult, especially by notational nonexperts, and using iconic graphics is one way of improvement. Very few studies attempted to replace 2D diagrams with immersive 3D visuals without objective evidence. We assume that it is due to a lack of quality criteria to compare 2D diagrams with 3D visuals. This paper will argue that human-centric 3D visuals should replace MBSE diagrams where appropriate. A new human-centric MBSE modelling environment motivates the adoption of interactive and immersive 3D visuals to facilitate communication and participation in multidisciplinary co-design activities from mission to concept definition. Our claim is not supported by measured evidence, but a functional demonstrator provides observed evidence and, compared to existing studies, we discuss our proposal based on the Physics of Notation. Future studies will concentrate on the modelling of the behavioural and structural views and the definition of criteria to validate the human-centric MBSE modelling environment. ? 2023 The Authors.

Stechert C.,Integrated Approach of Model-Based Systems Engineering and Augmented Reality for the Development of Rail Vehicles with Alternative Drives,2023,Procedia CIRP,1,"In order to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions, rail vehicles are increasingly being equipped with alternative drives. Multi-system vehicles in particular are becoming very complex as a result. This results in elaborate testing as well as complex training for production, operation and maintenance. This publication is intended to contribute to the systematic and targeted development of new rail vehicles for passenger transport. Using model-based systems engineering and the modelling language SysML, harmonised requirements are documented, assigned to the new systems and targeted test cases are developed. Augmented reality experiences are then created to support the execution of the test cases during validation runs, commissioning and maintenance activities. The augmented reality experiences allow virtual information and the real environment to be linked and displayed on a mobile device. The aim of this publication is to present an end-to-end process that already takes the requirements of training into account during product development, so that it is easy to implement training using augmented reality technologies. ? 2023 The Authors.

Schluse M.; Atorf L.; Rossmann J.,Experimentable digital twins for model-based systems engineering and simulation-based development,2017,Annual IEEE International Systems Conference,72,"The concepts and methodologies behind Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) hold great promises concerning the development of complex systems. Various projects have been carried out successfully during the last years and demonstrated the power behind the overall concept - and the practical problems to reach the ambitious overall goals. Whereas the first steps of MBSE like the iterative modeling of requirements, designs, behaviors, and tests became standard procedures in Systems Engineering (SE), the transition to simulation often is still restricted to quite simple scenarios. Although elaborated system models deliver all the information needed, the simulation of the overall system in prospective working environments interacting with other systems is rather an exception. The problem is that there is still quite a gap between the first SE steps and the various algorithms simulation technology can offer today. Major reasons for this seem to be the resulting complexity of the system model when modeling complex interactions, the complexity of using state-of-the-art simulation technology and the absence of simulation frameworks for simulations across multiple domains and disciplines. ""Experimentable Digital Twins"", a concept originally developed for the eRobotics methodology, seem to have the potential to close the gap between SE and simulation by introducing a new structuring element to configure simulations. A new simulation system architecture integrating well-known simulation algorithms provides Virtual Testbeds for the simultaneous simulation of a network of different Digital Twins interacting with each other in various ways (i.e. a network of different systems, their components and their working environment). This approach has been successfully used for a variety of different applications in multiple research areas. As one application, it allows for the simulation-based optimization of parameters, system structure etc. ? 2017 IEEE.",eRobotics; Experimentable Digital Twin; Simulation Technology; Virtual Testbed,Complex networks; Iterative methods; Optimization; Systems engineering; Testbeds; Erobotics; Experimentable Digital Twin; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Simulation algorithms; Simulation technologies; Simulation-based optimizations; Virtual test beds; Virtual reality,"Institute for Man-Machine Interaction RWTH Aachen University Aachen, Germany",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,DT,DT,Simulation and visualization,Robotics

The resulting networks of interacting EDTs model different application scenarios and are simulated in virtual testbeds, providing new foundations for comprehensive simulation-based systems engineering. Its focus is on EDTs, which become more detailed with every single application. Thus, complete digital representations of the respective real assets and their behaviors are created successively.

Barosan I.; Van Der Heijden J.,Integration of SysML models in a 3D environment for Virtual Testing and Validation,2022,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,1,"Model-Driven Systems Engineering has been presented as a promising approach for developing complex systems. To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system's development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.  ? 2022 Owner/Author.",3D modeling; Digital Twin; model conversion; model execution; model validation; Model-Driven Systems Engineering; SysML; Virtual Environment,Computer aided design; Integration testing; Large scale systems; Systems engineering; Virtual reality; 3D models; 3d representations; 3d-modeling; Driven system; Model conversion; Model executions; Model validation; Model-driven; Model-driven system engineering; SysML; 3D modeling,"Philips Eindhoven, The Netherlands juan.vander.heijden@philips.com",Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,DT,DT,Simulation and visualization,Vehicle

Lutfi M.; Valerdi R.,Integration of SysML and Virtual Reality Environment: A Ground Based Telescope System Example,2023,Systems,1,"In recent years, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has continued to develop as a standard for designing, managing, and maintaining increasingly complex systems. Unlike the document centric approach, MBSE puts the model at the heart of system design. Among the various MBSE language development efforts, ¡°Systems Modeling Language (SysML)¡±, is the most anticipated and broadly utilized in the research and in industrial practice. SysML originated from Unified Modeling Language (UML) and follows the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM). SysML diagrams help users create various systems engineering artifacts, including requirements, use cases, operational concepts, system architecture, system behaviors, and parametric analyses of a system model. In the early days of implementation, MBSE languages, including SysML, typically relied on static viewpoints and limited simulation support to depict and analyze a system model. Due the continuous improvement efforts and new implementation approaches by researchers and organizations, SysML has advanced vastly to encompass dynamic viewpoints, in-situ simulation and enable integration with external modeling and simulation (M&S) tools. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a user interactive and immersive visualization technology and can depict reality in a virtual environment at different levels of fidelity. VR can play a crucial role in developing dynamic and interactive viewpoints to improve the MBSE approach. In this research paper, the authors developed and implemented a methodology for integrating SysML and VR, enabling tools to achieve three dimensional viewpoints, an immersive user experience and early design evaluations of the system of interest (SOI). The key components of the methodology being followed in this research paper are the SysML, a VR environment, extracted data and scripting languages. The authors initially developed a SysML for a ground-based telescope system following the four pillars of SysML: Structure, Requirements, Behavior and Parametrics. The SysML diagram components are exported from the model using the velocity template language and then fed into a virtual reality game engine. Then, the SysML diagrams are visualized in the VR environment to enable better comprehension and interaction with users and Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In addition, a VR simulation scenario of space objects is generated based on the input from the SysML, and the simulation result is sent back from the VR tool into the model with the aid of parametric diagram simulation. Hence, by utilizing the developed SysML-VR integration methodology, VR environment scenarios are successfully integrated with the SysML. Finally, the research paper mentions a few limitations of the current implementation and proposes future improvements. ? 2023 by the authors.",digital twin; model-based systems engineering; SysML; virtual reality,\,"M.

Madni A.M.,Expanding stakeholder participation in upfront system engineering through storytelling in virtual worlds,2015,Systems Engineering,37,"Over the last decade, systems engineers have successfully created system modeling languages to communicate with other systems engineers. However, the ability to communicate an evolving system concept and design with stakeholders who are nonengineers remains an elusive goal. In large part, this inability stems from the latter having to understand complex diagrams and equations, and learn new notations employed by systems modeling languages. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that systems today have to frequently adapt to changing operational and regulatory requirements. Thus, to effectively communicate concepts of operation (CONOPS) and evolving system design to those outside the engineering discipline requires a different approach. This paper presents an innovative approach that employs technical storytelling methods to contextualize and map systems engineering (SE) artifacts represented in SysML to virtual worlds within which various storylines can play out. This capability is intended to improve comprehensibility and transparency of CONOPS and system designs when it comes to communicating with the broader stakeholder community. At the heart of this approach is a virtual world enabled by a 3D game engine, and a mapping capability that allows translation of SE artifacts and interdependencies to virtual world entities and interactions. The key idea behind this integrated capability is to allow the broader stakeholder community to collaborate effectively on key decisions during upfront SE. The benefits of this approach are greater stakeholder satisfaction, avoidance of rework, and more responsive system design. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Model-based systems engineering; Storytelling; Virtual world,Design; Interactive computer graphics; Systems engineering; Virtual reality; Engineering disciplines; Model-based systems engineering; Stakeholder participation; Stakeholder satisfactions; Storytelling; System modeling languages; Systems modeling languages; Virtual worlds; Systems analysis,"Systems Architecting and Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089",John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus,VR,VR,Simulation and visualization,Other£¨Safe£©

Current development primarily focuses on modelling of the product and its behaviour. The consideration of the product context also plays an important role. Virtual product development has the potential to support the designer by giving a blink into the later life-phases and context. It supports the early verification of product requirements and can also help to discover unseen requirements by means of use-case scenarios inside VR. A user and task oriented development method using VR can help to reduce the design uncertainties considerably.

Mahboob A.; Husung S.; Weber C.; Liebal A.; Kr?mker H.,An approach for building product use-case scenarios in different virtual reality systems,2018,ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,6,"During the product development process, it is of great importance to consider the later life phase situations of a product. This includes the interaction of the product with its environment and the human actor(s) in its different life phases. Therefore, an early evaluation of a product and its later life phase interactions are of great value. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is seen as very important at this point, as it can help the designer to realize the later life phase situations of a product inside VR. However, the preparation of VR-scenes remains a difficult task, as it requires a great amount of time and effort. Furthermore, the current methods for the preparation of such scenes offer very limited reusability. This paper will focus on an existing method that uses Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to describe the VR-scene for a CAVE-type VR-system. This method will be further extended and an improvement to the existing modeling approach will be presented to achieve a faster simulation in VR and reusability of VR-scenes. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of the conventional and the new approach will be presented. The new approach enables a faster simulation that will be validated by comparing the execution speed of both approaches under the modeling approach section. The reusability perspective of the prepared VR-scene will also be discussed. A Head Mounted Display (HMD), in comparison with CAVE type VR-systems, offers a cost reduction in the use of VR technology. This paper will also provide the idea for achieving a simulation in HMD while using the same MBSE-approach used for CAVE type VR-systems. The flow of information for simulation in HMD and the idea of implementation will be presented in detail.

Indeed, detailed design benefits from much more sophisticated methods and tools than the specification and architecture activities. Although, we should note the recent paradigm shift from document-based to model-based systems engineering, these models, which are mainly static 2D diagrams, remain poor to facilitate design verification early on. Thus, to detect most errors during the design phase, companies have no other alternative than to wait up to the testing phase which occurs after several years of development for complex systems. Thus, we propose a user-centric computer-aided verification process to ensure that the design meets the requirements under realistic operational conditions. The verification process provides a progressive immersion into the virtual system before seamlessly transitioning to the real system. Our work is built upon state-of-the-art MBSE methods such as the Property Model Methodology, which enables systems engineers to co-simulate specification models and design models. We improve such MBSE methods by increasing the level of realism that experiences the end-user during the verification of a design by the original combination of Model-In-the-Loop, Immersive Model-In-the-Loop, Human-In-the-Loop, and Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation strategies.

We discuss the need for and opportunities for convergence of three often segregated SE methodologies: Product engineering, human systems integration, and mission/operations analysis by expanding the product or process engineering view of a digital twin to the mission level. In the present this gives us a framework to analyze and specify automation and adaptation opportunities at the mission level. In the future we envision this twin continuously operates with the real systems to manage both emergent mission conditions and lifecycle adaptation. We applied this framework to a complex military mission using a case where artificial intelligence can be incorporated widely across a set of mission tasks to significantly improve performance. ? 2019 IEEE.",\,Embedded systems; Engineering education; Life cycle; System of systems; Advanced technology; Analysis and synthesis; Design and operations; Human systems integration; Improve performance; Integration frameworks; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Product engineering; Cyber Physical System,"Dennis J.

Hause M.,The Digital Twin Throughout the SE Lifecycle,2019,INCOSE International Symposium,8,"A digital twin is much as it sounds: a digital representation of a specific asset in the field, including current and past configuration states, considering serialized parts, software versions, options, and variants. Condition data is also represented including sensor readings, alerts, and operating environments. A digital twin has significant implications for service, operations, analysis, design, etc. especially when visualized as a Computer Aided Design (CAD)-sourced graphic in 3D virtual or augmented reality. Using this immersive and real-time information, engineers can inspect and verify the asset being serviced, designed or operated to get precise product information. However, the digital twin does not spring into life fully formed straight from the CAD model. It requires an informed system engineering approach to ensure that the integration between physical and digital is fit for purpose. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) models can be used in conjunction with the digital twin to improve operational models, predict and analyze faults, perform best-fit analysis and eliminate inappropriate system configurations, etc. This paper will look at various aspects of the digital twin and how it can be used in conjunction with MBSE.",\,\,"PTC Needham, Mass, USA MHause@ptc.com",INCOSE-International Council on Systems Engineering,Conference paper,Wiley,DT,DT,Verification and validation,Other£¨IoT£©
Delbr¨¹gger T.; Rossmann J.,Representing adaptation options in experimentable digital twins of production systems,2019,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,29,"Simulations are powerful tools for decision support during factory adaptation processes. In order to provide the most valuable form of decision support, a tool must take into account the decision problem and relevant decision alternatives. Today¡¯s simulation tools, however, only accept simple notions of variability, like numeric parameter ranges. Thereby they ignore most of the variability of production systems, and do not utilise their full potential to aid decisions. To improve this situation, a new concept on how to systematically model the variability of production systems in Digital Twins of production entities is proposed. It combines Model-Based Systems Engineering and Variability Management to model different variants of production systems, and utilises capabilities of production equipment to make Digital Twins modular and reconfigurable. Each valid combination of variants results in a directly 3D-simulable Digital Twin for the whole production system, allowing automatic validation testing and fast feedback loops during system development. The presented concept is not only a very important basis for managing variants. As the variants model can be used as a search space for optimisation algorithms, the concept is an important stepping stone for a more powerful simulation-based optimisation of production systems. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",capabilities; Digital twin; MBSE; model-based systems engineering; modelling; variability modeling; Virtual Testbeds,Models; Optimization; Systems engineering; capabilities; Digital twins; MBSE; Model-based systems engineering; Variability modelling; Virtual test beds; Decision support systems,"T.

Starting from research and engineering activities, up to production and delivery, the need of maintaining the trace of dependence, changes, and possible updates regarding the final product is a crucial aspect for success. Particularly, conceptual and preliminary design activities are affected by a high level of uncertainty and a certain degree of project instability, usually caused by the need to explore alternative solutions and variants. Different tasks are performed concerning the identification of system requirements, functional and physical behavior using model-based design (MBD), and model-based systems engineering, which, generally, are subjected to extensive trade studies aimed at identifying the best solution. In this context, this paper presents how model-based digital twin and threads concepts will likely change the way in which the MBD process is managed, overcoming the issues associated with federated IT infrastructures and with tools integration. Notably, lifecycle and nonlifecycle related interoperability aspects are described, with particular focus on the exploitation of standards for lifecycle collaboration and heterogeneous simulation.

Specifically, a reflective architecture developed around digital twins enables representation and control of system Configuration Items properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis.

Wagner H.; Portenlanger L.; Zuccaro C.,Using SysML Models as Digital Twins for Early Validation of Modular Systems and Systems of Systems,2023,Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference,1,"For early validation of system concepts, reviews of SysML models can be complemented by employing simulation models as virtual prototypes. Such simulation models can be gradually expanded into digital twins during system development. However, it is usually difficult to include all relevant physical aspects of the system or its context in such models. Also, the creation of such models is usually laborious. To be able to validate the system concept early without much effort and nevertheless considering the real context and physical details, in this paper the SysML model itself is used as a digital twin to control real prototypes in a real context. To create real prototypes rapidly, already existing components are re-used to set up modular systems or Systems of Systems (SoS). The presented approach has been successfully evaluated through rapid development of an SoS consisting of a drone swarm and an autonomously driving vehicle.  ? 2023 IEEE.",digital twin; MBSE; modular systems; System of Systems; validation,Verification; MBSE; Modular system; Physical aspects; Simulation model; System concepts; System development; System-of-systems; Validation; System of systems,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology University of Applied Sciences Munich Munich, Germany claudio.zuccaro@hm.edu",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,DT,DT,Verification and validation,Aerospace£¨UAV£©

Systems engineers use an MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) approach to describe different views of a system (requirements, operational view, functional view, behavioral view, logical and physical architecture views). The system model is useful to design the system architecture in either a static or a dynamic perspective. The first step in systems engineering is the requirements specification. This is an important step in the development phase, since the system must satisfy the defined requirements (functional and physical), to be able to choose the right architecture solution. Many trade-off methods exist: in some cases, it is sufficient to use parametric diagrams to calculate the system performances based on the functional causality of the system, and to execute simulations in the system modeler tool. However, there are some performances that need a more complex dynamic model requiring, for instance, differential equations, as well as a suitable solver, in a dedicated simulation tool, especially when the system is a complex mechatronic system, that needs multiphysics simulation. Many industries have adopted the digital twin (DT) concept in their activities, because of its fidelity and precision. It is highly recommended to use DT models during the early phases of development in order to verify system requirements, with a view to reducing development costs [18]. It is then necessary to ensure digital thread between system models and DT simulation models. To address these issues, this paper presents a collaboration methodology between simulation engineers and system engineers. The aim is to achieve earlier requirements verification and trade-off decisions. In order to fulfill these objectives, it is necessary to ensure the traceability of models changes and to reduce the probability of miss-understandings. For this reason, the MIC (Model Identity Card) concept is used in the proposed methodology.  ? 2024 IEEE.",Digital Twin; MBSE; Mechatronic; MIC; Requirements; Simulation; Verification,Architecture; Differential equations; Economic and social effects; Engineers; Microwave integrated circuits; Identity cards; Model identity card; Model-based system engineerings; Requirement; Requirement verifications; Simulation; System engineers; System models; System requirements; Trade off; Memory architecture,"I.

Grimmeisen P.; Wortmann A.; Morozov A.,Case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of software-defined manufacturing based on digital twins,2022,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2,"Traditional production systems are characterized by rare software updates and fixed production lines. Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-To-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology. In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework. ? 2022 ACM.",case study; digital twin; M2M Transformation; reliability assessment; software-defined manufacturing; SysML v2,Safety engineering; Software reliability; Case-studies; Enabling technologies; Hybrid reliability models; Model-to-model (M2M) transformation; Production line; Production system; Reliability assessments; Software updates; Software-defined manufacturing; SysML v2; Reliability analysis,"andrey.morozov@ias.uni-stuttgart.de University of Stuttgart Stuttgart, Germany",Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,"DT, Machine learning (Markov chain)",DT+ML,Verification and validation,Industry

Gregory J.; Salado A.,A Semantic Approach to Spacecraft Verification Planning Using Bayesian Networks,2024,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,4,"The design and execution of an effective spacecraft verification strategy is a critical and complex undertaking. It necessitates the generation and management of a large amount of highly connected data. As a result, verification activities consume a significant part, if not the biggest part, of the development costs of large-scale engineered systems. Current document-based approaches to verification planning and assessment are inefficient, prone to inconsistencies, and unable to quantitatively inform about the confidence level on the verification status of the system of interest. A Digital Engineering (DE) approach to verification planning and assessment can overcome these weaknesses. To achieve this, data integration and management technologies are crucial. Semantic Web Technologies (SWTs) provide a means to structure knowledge, validate knowledge, and infer new knowledge using ontologies, reasoners, and query languages. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to planning verification strategies supported by the Bayesian Verification Ontology Stack (BVOS). The BVOS is a modular ontology stack that supports a semantic approach to DE. The ontologies it comprises are constructed using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML). The BVOS leverages existing ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) to support the required domain-level ontologies such as the System Architecture Ontology and the Bayesian Network Ontology. To evaluate this approach, it has been applied to the Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) of a notional spacecraft and its verification strategy. The ADCS requirements are captured in Jama Connect. The physical architecture of the ADCS and the corresponding verification strategy are modeled using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) v2. A representative OML knowledge graph that captures the entire dataset is produced and validated using the BVOS, and is used to generate a Bayesian representation of the verification strategy. ? 2024 IEEE.",\,Bayesian networks; Data integration; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Modeling languages; Network architecture; Query languages; Semantic Web; Attitude determination and control subsystems; Bayesia n networks; Bayesian; Digital engineering; Large amounts; Ontological modeling; Ontology's; Result verifications; Semantic approach; Verification Strategy; Ontology,"J.

A toolchain is presented to support the implementation, which consists of a set of enabling software corresponding to the functional modules of the framework. Different manufacturing system architectures are first designed by industrial system engineers supported by the application ontology stored in a graph database. They are then analyzed through Discrete Event Simulations and 3D simulations. The simulation results are presented through a web-based portal to show the key performance values of each architecture.

(QSI)'s integrated tool set, consisting of TEAMS-Designer? and TEAMS-RDS? provides a comprehensive model-based systems engineering approach that can be deployed for fault management throughout the equipment life-cycle - from its design for fault management to condition-based maintenance of the equipment. The TEAMS? failure-cause effect dependency model is a digital twin representation of the equipment in its failure-space and allows for various types of analyses such as testability, serviceability, failure propagation and others that facilitate fault management design of the equipment. The same model is deployed through TEAMS-RDS? for condition monitoring, prognostics, real-time health assessment, failure impact analysis, guided troubleshooting and others that facilitate condition-based maintenance as well as ensure efficient and rapid maintenance actions. In this paper, we present an overview of QSI's integrated toolset, with a focus on a systematic model-based approach towards an automated development of Failure Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and other relevant analyses for the equipment, for an improved understanding of failure effects and their causality at the system-level. The eventual objective here is improved equipment design as well as designing improved failure detection, failure isolation and failure mitigation. The paper will also discuss examples of such real-world applications for smart manufacturing in major depot maintenance facilities in the US. A subsequent paper will focus on the development and integration of process-level and equipment-level FMECAs for Smart Manufacturing applications. ? 2019 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

The impacts of these development inefficiencies are exacerbated when larger and more complex trade spaces need to be managed while encompassing the different architecture topologies and implementation options necessary to converge on a more optimal system design. This paper will discuss how Model Based Systems Engineering, specifically digital twin pipelines, can be beneficial to the product development lifecycle in a Model Based Engineering Environment. Such an approach brings modeling earlier into the design cycle, supports more perceptive system architectural and design trades, and systematic qualification. Maintaining a consistent set of system models that evolve with the maturity of the design provides an integrated and collaborative development environment that will inform detailed requirements derivation and implementation decisions towards a more capable and efficient system design. ? 2023 IEEE.",\,Commerce; Life cycle; Space research; Systems analysis; 'current; Engineering implementation; Model-based OPC; Model-based system engineerings; Optimal systems design; Product development process; Space exploration mission; Systems development life cycle; Technical complexity; Trade space; Product development,"R.

The aim of the original model was to design and integrate an architecture of digital twins derived from business needs that leveraged the potential of the synergies in the ecosystem. The conceptual framework presented in this paper extends the semantic ontology model for integrating the digital twins. For the original model, technical modeling approaches were developed and integrated into an ecosystem perspective based on a modeling of the ecosystem and the actors¡¯ decision jobs. In a service ecosystem comprising several enterprises and a multitude of actors, decision making is based on the interlinkage of the digital twins of the equipment and the processes, which is achieved by the semantic ontology model further elaborated in this paper. The implementation of the digital twin architecture is shown in the example of a manufacturing SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) case that was introduced in. The mixed semantic modeling and model-based systems engineering for this implementation is discussed in further detail in this paper. The findings of this detailed study provide a theoretical concept for implementing digital twins on the level of service ecosystems and integrating digital twins based on a unified ontology. This provides a practical blueprint to companies for developing digital twin based services in their own operations and beyond in their ecosystem. ? 2021 by the authors.

Li H.; Wang G.; Lu J.; Kiritsis D.,Cognitive twin construction for system of systems operation based on semantic integration and high-level architecture,2022,Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering,15,"With the increasing complexity of engineered systems, digital twins (DTs) have been widely used to support integrated modeling, simulation, and decision-making of the system of systems (SoS). However, when integrating DTs of each constituent system, it is challenging to implement complexity management, interface definition, and service integration across DTs. This study proposes a new concept called cognitive twin (CT) to support SoS development and operation. CTs have been defined as DTs with augmented semantic capabilities for promoting the understanding of interrelationships be-tween virtual models and enhancing the decision-making. First, CTs aim to integrate the information description of DTs across constituent systems using a unified ontology and semantic modeling technique. Second, CTs provide integrated simulations among DTs for decision-making of the SoS based on a high-level architecture (HLA). Finally, through reasoning ontology models, CTs provide decision-making options for the operations of real constituent systems. A case study on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) landing on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is used to verify the flexibility of this approach. From the results, we find that the CT based on the proposed ontology provides a unified formalism of DTs across UAVs and USVs. Moreover, the reasoning based on the CT provides decision-making capabilities for UAVs by implementing cognitive computing to select target USVs for landing.  ? 2022 - IOS Press.

Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is widely used for UAV development, particularly for the layout design of UAV radar cabin. In this paper, a semantic modeling approach based on KARMA language is proposed to create the system model of the radar cabin layout based on an MBSE approach for formalizing Requirement, Function, Logical and Physical structure (RFLP). Moreover, the KARMA models for UAV radar cabin layout modeling are transformed to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in MATLAB toolkit for radar cabin layout optimization by code generation. Based on the layout information generated from the KARMA models, the optimized layout solution is generated by the MATLAB toolkit. From the case study, we find the KARMA language enables to formalize the radar cabin design based on nine diagrams of SysML specification. And optimizations can be executed automatically after getting data generated from KARMA models. Thereby, the proposed semantic modeling approach improves design efficiency and quality during radar cabin design. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",KARMA; MBSE; Radar cabin layout; RFLP,Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Industrial management; Radar; Semantics; Systems engineering; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Integrated modeling; Layout optimization; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Physical structures; Semantic model approaches; SysML specification; UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle); Modeling languages,"Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100000, China",Springer,Conference paper,Scopus,"KG, Ontology",KG+Ontology,Optimization and decision-making,Aerospace£¨UAV£©

However, the existing theories and methods of product design are lack research on the integration of modeling concepts, domain-specific knowledge, and decision-making. For this reason, this paper proposes a C-D-K theory which is supported by a semantic modeling approach. Firstly, KARMA modeling language, which is a semantics modeling approach, is used to support the formalization of concept space (C) and decision space (D), in which space C is expanded based on the RFLP design framework, and space D is based on PEI-X decision workflow to realize decision problem modeling. Then based on the Open service lifecycle collaboration (OSLC) specification, domain-specific knowledge is represented based on the unified expression of resources in the knowledge space (K), which is used to integrate knowledge to semantics models constructed by KARMA language. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed semantic modeling approach are verified by the case of an unmanned detection vehicle design. From the result, we find the semantics modeling approach enables to integrate semantic models and knowledge based on the C-D-K theory. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",C-D-K theory; KARMA; MBSE; Semantic modeling,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Industrial management; Knowledge based systems; Life cycle; Product design; Semantics; Concept decisions; Decision problems; Design frameworks; Domain-specific knowledge; Knowledge based; Knowledge spaces; Modeling concepts; Semantic model approaches; Modeling languages,"Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100000, China",Springer,Conference paper,Scopus,"KG, Ontology",KG+Ontology,Optimization and decision-making,Vehicle

In SysDICE the optimization that led to the determination of the best alternative combinations for satisfying the requirements was time-costly and discarded prohibited combinations.

Guariniello C.; Mockus L.; Raz A.K.; Delaurentis D.A.,Towards Intelligent Architecting of Aerospace System-of-Systems,2019,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,12,"System-of-Systems (SoS) are composed of large scale independent and complex heterogeneous systems which collaborate to create capabilities not achievable by a single system, for example air transportation system, satellite constellations, and space exploration architectures. Much of the research effort in the field of SoS has focused on the analysis of these complex entities, while there are still major gaps in developing tools for automated synthesis and engineering of SoS that consider all the various aspects in this problem domain. The gap we address in this paper is a mapping of clusters of SoS architecture alternatives, segmented by performance along multiple metrics, to architectural features. Building upon our previous research where we used a SoS Analytic Work Bench in combination with Model-Based Systems Engineering artifacts to perform analysis of aerospace systems, we propose to build a process for intelligent architecting of aerospace SoS. This process discovers and employs pertinent features in a complex design space to effectively meet the user needs, elevating SoS engineering from retrospective architectural analysis to automated synthesis of new architectures. As a first step towards intelligent architecture of aerospace SoS, we propose to utilize Machine Learning techniques to automate the synthesis phase of SoS. Our hypothesis is that a set of holistic metrics of aerospace architectures (cost, performance, robustness, operational risk, average delay, etc.) can be used to characterize a measure of goodness of architectures, with good architectures on a Pareto front of the multi-dimensional space of holistic metrics of interest. Each architecture or cluster may be then mapped to a set of architectural features, with the goal of identifying which features belong to good architectures. Specifically, we propose to utilize non-parametric regression on a set of training architectures (for example, Neural Networks can deal with mixed real and integer variables) to associate each one with a pattern of features. This mapping will allow the automated process to predict what metrics will be expected from SoS architectures with specific features, and therefore to automatically synthesize architectures that exhibit desired characteristics of goodness. For example, for constellations of satellites, a group of good architecture might have medium cost, high resilience, medium robustness, and low risk, and the architectural features to be mapped to each group can include number of satellites, number of components, type of orbit, type of power system, etc. Since the environment constantly evolves, architectures must adapt, and stochastic optimization can be used to switch between architectures with minimal effort. In this work we illustrate the new version of our aerospace SoS analysis and synthesis framework, which includes Machine Learning techniques to support synthesis of SoS architectures. We demonstrate the application of this process on satellite constellations and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps. ? 2019 IEEE.",\,Air transportation; Automation; Cluster computing; Complex networks; Engineering research; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Network architecture; Optimization; Orbits; Risk assessment; Satellites; Space research; System of systems; Air transportation systems; Complex heterogeneous systems; Intelligent architectures; Machine learning techniques; Model-based systems engineering; Non-parametric regression; Real and integer variables; Space exploration architecture; Computer architecture,Purdue University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics 701 W.

Irrespective of industries, the main source of power that enables electrification in mobility applications like electric vehicles (EV), electric ships and electrical vertical take-off & landing (e-VTOL) is primarily a battery making it fundamentally a DC system. Fast charging solutions for EVs & e-VTOLs are also found to be DC in nature because of several advantages like ease of integration, higher efficiency, etc. Likewise, the key drivers of the electric grid are resulting in an energy transition towards renewable sources, that are also essentially DC in nature. Overall, these different business trends with their drivers appear to be converging towards DC power systems, making it pertinent. However, DC circuit protection poses serious challenges compared to AC due to the absence of natural zero-crossing points and the high rise rate of fault current demanding the need for fast-acting protective devices. Circuit breakers as protective devices are advantageous because of their resettable feature. This has prompted engineers to look beyond their conventional purview and explore developments in mechanical technologies of fast-acting switches & power electronics technologies to develop circuit protection solutions for DC systems. The result has been the development of solid-state circuit breakers (SSCB) and hybrid circuit breakers (HCB), making their design and analysis crucial. Thus, this paper focuses primarily on the model-based analysis of SSCB & HCB used for DC circuit protection in mobility applications. System-level models of the breakers are developed and integrated with a DC power distribution system. Key critical to quality (CTQs) of the design like response time, power loss, temperature rise, rate of rise of fault current, current commutation, and drop in DC bus voltage are predicted. Also, sensitivity to design parameters is analyzed. As there are a variety of architectures for these breakers, a Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) approach is adopted to have an ideal framework for tracking and evaluating different architectures. Further, a Machine Learning (ML) based Reduced-Order Model (ROM) is developed, embedded in the MBSE framework for quick model-based sensitivity and optimization studies for faster product-to-market without compromising on accuracy. ? 2024 Eaton Intelligent Power, Ltd.",\,Electric circuit breakers; Electric network analysis; Electric ship equipment; Electric utilities; Power quality; Timing circuits; Circuit protection; Circuit-breakers; D.C Circuit; DC circuits; DC system; Engineering frameworks; Machine-learning; Model-based system engineerings; Power; System-level modeling; Economic and social effects,"Eaton Corporation, Eaton India Innovation Cente",SAE International,Conference paper,Scopus,Machine learning (Reduced order model),ML,Optimization and decision-making,Vehicle

The developed design methodology takes into account design features of the mechanisms and describes the process of creating and transforming descriptive semantic models of electric drives. Different forms of such models on the one hand provide a visual representation of design factors, on the other allowing the use of a known mathematical apparatus to automate the search and analysis of design decisions. For electric drive requirements modeling SysML language is used. Further obtained model is converted into a semantic network in the form of a conceptual graph (CG). This graph has a mathematical description in the form of logical expressions and can be used by an inference machine for automatic analysis and synthesis of technical solutions. Other knowledge models of electric drives design are considered. To take into account the inconsistency of the requirements, the model in form of conceptual graph is transformed into description necessary for applying the GORE methodology tools. To take into account the incomplete certainty of design factors, a Bayesian network is built on the basis of the conceptual graph.

However, for novel systems, relevant data available is limited. In this work, we propose a framework informing model-based mission assurance activities with historical incident reports, lessons learned, or other relevant engineering documents using natural language processing. In doing so, we investigate whether there is useful information in data sets that are relevant, if not identical, to the system under design and whether, through rigorous systems engineering practice, this information can be effectively leveraged through model-based failure analysis. In a worked case study, we apply state-of-the-art topic modeling techniques to two data sets, a mission relevant data set and a system relevant data set. The sets of topics are merged and interpreted to form a preliminary list of failure topics that can be used to inform the identification of off-nominal modes in the model-based failure modes and effects analysis development. Once data from the system in operation is available, it can be used to update the topics identified. By extracting information about likely failures from relevant historical data sets and utilizing model-based mission assurance to ensure relevance and rigor, unanticipated failures can be reduced, and projects can more effectively learn from past missions. ? 2024 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Yuan W.; Liu Y.; Zhao J.; Wang H.,Pattern-based integration of system optimization in mechatronic system design,2016,Advances in Engineering Software,11,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a promising methodology for the design of complex mechatronic systems. There are some tools developed to support MBSE in complex system design and modeling. However, none of them has got the functionality of supporting system optimization. This work is precisely motivated by this gap and aims to develop effective methods to support automatic system optimization for MBSE. Specifically, a pattern-based method is proposed to support the integration of system optimization into mechatronic system design. In such a method, optimization problems, their solving methods and computation results are formally defined in each pattern based on the System Modeling Language (SysML). In addition, a model description scheme termed an optimization profile is proposed based on SysML to include the components for formalizing different kinds of optimization problems and optimization methods. After an optimization profile is created for an optimization problem, system optimization methods can be chosen automatically from the pattern library based on a semantic similarity evaluation. Then, optimization results are provided to users to support decision-making and the pattern library is updated using the relevant information obtained in this process. A system design example is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed methods. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Several authors have described this phase of Engineering Design. The Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) is one of these models. This study is based on the combined use of a modified version of Gero's FBS model and the latest developments of modeling languages for systems engineering. System Modeling Language (SysML) is a general-purpose graphical modeling language for specifying, analyzing, designing, and verifying complex systems. Our development shows how SysML types of diagrams match with our updated vision of the FBS model of conceptual design. The objective of this paper is to present the possibility to use artificial intelligence tools as members of the design team for supporting the synthesis process. The common point of expert systems developed during last decades for the synthesis of conceptual solutions is that their knowledge bases were application dependent. Latest research in the field of Ontology showed the possibility to build knowledge representations in a reusable and shareable manner This allows the construction of knowledge representation for engineering in a more generic manner and dynamic mapping of the ontology layers.

Fuchs M.; Beckert F.; Rauscher F.; Goetz C.; Biedermann J.; Nagel B.,VIRTUAL RECONFIGURATION AND ASSESSMENT OF AIRCRAFT CABINS USING MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING,2022,International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences,1,"In order to create a detailed digital cabin, virtual models are combined with the geometric data of physical cabin components. This digital cabin can be used to analyse maintenance times, find optimization potential or test the integration of new technologies (e.g. hydrogen powered systems). This requires different levels of detail of the virtual cabin model as well as an automated data (e.g. 3D models, parameters) transfer infrastructure between them. However, this model structure is challenged by the complexity of the system to be mapped due to subsystems and interconnections. In addition, it requires an integration and preparation of the transmitted data (3D models, process data). This paper presents a method that addresses these challenges and introduces an architecture for building a virtual cabin for reconfiguration and analysis of new cabin variants. Model-based systems engineering is used to create a digital model of the aircraft cabin and its systems. The model is used for an automated reconfiguration of the cabin and consists of formalized knowledge and requirements. In addition, a 3D scan process is applied that digitizes the physical cabin subcomponents (e.g. riser duct) to increase the level of detail and to consider uncertainties. Subsequently, all data and models are visualized in a virtual reality environment in which users can interact with it and make direct changes to the layout. These changes are automatically transferred to the conceptual cabin design process for an automated reconfiguration and examination of the layout regarding the requirements. As a result, a baseline architecture for the digital cabin has been created, which enables fast system reconfigurability, traceability of changes, identification of interdependencies, and investigation of new cabin variations (retrofit). ? 2022 ICAS.

Wang H.; Li H.; Wen X.; Luo G.,Unified modeling for digital twin of a knowledge-based system design,2021,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,48,"While Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) improves the ambiguity problem of the conventional document-based way, it brings management complexity. Faced with the complexity, one of the core issues that companies care about is how to effectively evaluate, predict, and manage it in the early system design stage. The inaccuracy of contemporary complexity measurement approaches still exits due to the inconsistency between the actual design process in physical space and the theoretical simulation in virtual space. Digital Twin (DT) provides a promising way to alleviate the problem by bridging the physical space and virtual space. Aiming to integrate DT with MBSE for the system design complexity analysis and prediction, based on previous work, an integration framework named System Design Digital Twin in 5 Dimensions was introduced from a knowledge perspective. The framework provides services for design complexity measurement, effort estimation, and change propagation prediction. Then, to represent the system design digital twin in a unified way, a modeling profile is constructed through SysML stereotypes. The modeling profile includes System design digital model in virtual space profile, system services profile, relationships profile and digital twin data profile.

"Houck K., Ritter C., Burnett T., Cavaluzzi J,",Beartooth: Nuclear material testbed with MBSE and digital twin,2022,INCOSE International Symposium,3,"Digital engineering can fundamentally change the construction and operation of complex projects. Traditional engineering teams operate in siloed tools and disparate teams. Throughout a project lifecycle, data is translated manually or over brittle point-to-point connections, which increases the risk of silent errors. These potential errors can cascade across the effort, resulting in significant project delays and cost overruns. Furthermore, traditional engineering projects are not designed for the rapid digitization that allows for advanced analytic tools. Digital engineering can create a cohesive data ?source of truth? to ensure a project is designed for the digital future. There is a need for a standard toolset to normalize and integrate project datasets. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed DeepLynx, a crucial tool to mitigate this data management problem. This paper introduces INL's digital engineering approach and provides a concrete example of a digital engineering design effort currently taking place with Beartooth, a new nuclear material processing testbed project.

Darm P.; Marchetti F.; Garcia G.; Redondo P.M.; Riccardi A.; Fern¨¢ndez A.G.,LEVERAGING LANGUAGE MODELS SEMANTIC SIMILARITY CAPABILITIES TO FACILITATE INFORMATION REUSE IN SYSTEM ENGINEERING,2023,International Astronautical Congress,0,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a powerful approach for designing complex engineering systems, which also generates valuable data after each conducted study. However, currently there are few to no approaches for reusing this information in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and a graph database to analyze data from past missions and facilitate the design process of new missions. In particular, we firstly develop techniques for analysing a database of past-mission requirements. This include the ability to identify semantic similar requirements from past missions for a given new requirement. We also fine-tune a language model in order to analyse the logical traceability between two requirements. These methods are meant to enable engineers to more efficiently define the requirement space for a new spacecraft.Secondly, we also develop methods to analyse the physical and functional architectures of past missions. Based on an input for a new design, a graph database of past-mission design can be queried for similar design choices and functionalities by again leveraging the abilities of semantic similarity and a specialised breadth-first-search algorithm. Finally, we show how both the requirement and design analyses could in order to automatically verify if the provisions of a requirements are reflected in the physical architecture. For this analysis, a language model is used to extract core concepts from a requirement. Then, in a second step, the concepts from the requirement are mapped to nodes in the graph database. For the actual verification, a relevant extract of the graph together with the requirement are then used as input for a large language model, which is prompted to reason if the requirement is fulfilled or not. By leveraging NLP and graph search techniques, we believe that these approaches can lead to more efficient and effective design processes for complex engineering systems by reusing information from past designs. The proposed techniques have been developed and tested on real past-mission requirements and design architectures in collaboration with Thales Alenia Space, RHEA group, and the European Space Agency.

Berquand A.; Murdaca F.; Riccardi A.; Soares T.; Gener¨¦ S.; Brauer N.; Kumar K.,Artificial Intelligence for the Early Design Phases of Space Missions,2019,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,19,"Recent introduction of data mining methods has led to a paradigm shift in the way we can analyze space data. This paper demonstrates that Artificial Intelligence (AI), and especially the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR), could also be successfully employed at the start of the space mission life cycle via an Expert System (ES) used as a Design Engineering Assistant (DEA). An ES is an AI-based agent used to solve complex problems in particular fields. There are many examples of ES being successfully implemented in the aeronautical, agricultural, legal or medical fields. Applied to space mission design, and in particular, in the context of concurrent engineering sessions, an ES could serve as a knowledge engine and support the generation of the initial design inputs, provide easy and quick access to previous design decisions or push to explore new design options. Integrated to the User design environment, the DEA could become an active assistant following the design iterations and flagging model inconsistencies. Today, for space missions design, experts apply methods of concurrent engineering and Model-Based System Engineering, relying both on their implicit knowledge (i.e., past experiences, network) and on available explicit knowledge (i.e., past reports, publications, data sheets). The former knowledge type represents still the most significant amount of data, mostly unstructured, non-digital or digital data of various legacy formats. Searching for information through this data is highly time-consuming. A solution is to convert this data into structured data to be stored into a Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be traversed by an inference engine to provide reasoning and deductions on its nodes. Knowledge is extracted from the KG via a User Interface (UI) and a query engine providing reliable and relevant knowledge summaries to the Human experts. The DEA project aims to enhance the productivity of experts by providing them with new insights into a large amount of data accumulated in the field of space mission design. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) methods are leveraged to develop the DEA. Building the knowledge base manually is subjective, time-consuming, laborious and error bound. This is why the knowledge base generation and population rely on Ontology Learning (OL) methods. This OL approach follows a modified model of the Ontology Layer Cake. This paper describes the approach and the parameters used for the qualitative trade-off for the selection of the software to be adopted in the architecture of the ES. The study also displays the first results of the multi-word extraction and highlights the importance of Word Sense Disambiguation for the identification of synonyms in the context. This paper includes the detailed software architecture of both front and back-ends, as well as the tool requirements. Both architectures and requirements were refined after a set of interviews with experts from the European Space Agency. The paper finally presents the preliminary strategy to quantify and mitigate uncertainties within the ES. ? 2019 IEEE.",\,Concurrent engineering; Data handling; Economic and social effects; Engines; Expert systems; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Ontology; Space flight; User interfaces; European Space Agency; Human-machine interaction; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Model-based system engineerings; Multi word extraction; NAtural language processing; Searching for informations; Word Sense Disambiguation; Data mining,"	Spacejunkies V.O.F (satsearch), Noordwijk, the Netherlands, kartik@satsearch.co ",IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,"NLP, KG, Ontology",KG+NLP+Ontology,Knowledge management and reuse,Aerospace£¨Spacecraft£©

Though MBSE models provide a completely structural formalisms about system development for system developers, such large of domain specific knowledge represented by models cannot be captured as what the developers expect. This leads to a big challenge when MBSE can be widely used for complex system development. In this paper, a knowledge management approach is proposed to support an intelligent question answering scenario when implementing MBSE in system lifecycle. We make use of the GOPPRR approach to support MBSE formalisms which are transformed to knowledge graph models. Then such models provide cues for intelligent question answers through reasoning. In the case study, we make use of an auto-braking system scenario to develop MBSE models and to implement the intelligent question answering. Finally, we find the availability of our approach is evaluated which the domain engineers enable to capture their domain knowledge more efficiently. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Knowledge graph modeling; Knowledge management; Knowledge reasoning; Model-based systems engineering,Information systems; Information use; Knowledge representation; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Systems engineering; Auto-braking systems; Domain knowledge; Domain-specific knowledge; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Question Answering; System developers; System development; Knowledge management,"J.

The problem of how to acquire the knowledge carried by the system model and reuse the system model is urgently required to be solved.

System model graph is constructed by defining the SysML metamodel ontology and the construction strategy is given. The entity alignment based on the relationship set and the rule-based reasoning is applied to achieve the fusion of multiple subgraphs, and the semantic extended retrieval of design requirements is realized based on this graph. Finally, the case studies of the Automatic Climate Control Integrated System of car and satellite design verify the effectiveness and practicability of the method, supporting system model reuse.

The system architectures, organizations, research and development processes using MBSE to design complex systems can be seen as a System of Systems (SoS), which has high complexity and hard to manage.

However, lack of cognition ability makes it hard to connect the models and data with human, processes and things in the SoS, which reduces the efficiency of complex system development. In this paper, a new concept named Cognitive Thread is first proposed as digital thread with augmented semantic capabilities for identifying the information of the SoS.

Lu J.; Ma J.; Zheng X.; Wang G.; Li H.; Kiritsis D.,Design Ontology Supporting Model-Based Systems Engineering Formalisms,2022,IEEE Systems Journal,19,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) provides an important capability for managing the complexities of system development. MBSE empowers the formalism of system architectures for supporting model-based requirement elicitation, specification, design, development, testing, fielding, etc. However, the modeling languages and techniques are heterogeneous, even within the same enterprise system, which leads to difficulties for data interoperability. The discrepancies among data structures and language syntaxes make information exchange among MBSE models more difficult, resulting in considerable information deviations when connecting data flows across the enterprise. Therefore, this article presents an ontology based upon graphs, objects, points, properties, roles, and relationships with extensions (GOPPRRE), providing metamodels that support the various MBSE formalisms across lifecycle stages. In particular, knowledge graph models are developed to support unified model representations to further implement ontological data integration based on GOPPRRE throughout the entire lifecycle. The applicability of the MBSE formalism is verified using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Moreover, the GOPPRRE ontologies are used to create the MBSE formalisms in a domain-specific modeling tool, MetaGraph, for evaluating its availability. The results demonstrate that the proposed ontology supports the formal structures and descriptive logic of the systems engineering lifecycle. ? 2007-2012 IEEE.",Formalism; interoperability; knowledge graph; model-based systems engineering; ontology,Availability; Data flow analysis; Data integration; Graph theory; Life cycle; Ontology; Semantics; Systems engineering; Unified Modeling Language; Formalism; Graph objects; Knowledge graphs; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling; Object points; Ontology's; Property; Systems engineering and theories; Interoperability,"G.

Nevertheless, a large quantity of knowledge is generated during the whole life cycle of complex products, and it is crucial to use this knowledge to implement iterative product design. The application of knowledge in the product design stage is mostly based on knowledge pushing from static knowledge base, which is prone to problems such as inefficient knowledge management and insufficient expression of semantic relationships, and does not combine with product iterative design scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes an iterative design knowledge pushing method combining SysML(System Modeling Language) and knowledge graphs. Firstly, the method constructs a SysML-based iterative product design system model for supporting the determination of iterative design intention scenarios. Secondly, the knowledge graph technology is used to unify the management and representation of product iterative design knowledge. Thirdly, the knowledge graph for the iterative design process is constructed oriented to the iterative feedback requirements based on FBS(Function-Behavior-Structure) and knowledge complexity calculation to determine the KDA(Knowledge Demand Anchor).

DeHart J.,Leveraging Large Language Models for Direct Interaction with SysML v2,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,0,"This paper examines the potential integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Systems Modeling Language version 2 (SysML v2), proposing a novel methodology for systems engineering by capitalizing on the enhanced readability and human-friendly syntax of SysML v2. Given the emergent sophistication of LLMs and the coincidental development of SysML v2?-an endeavor that presents a pivot toward naturally articulated model interaction?-we explore the possibilities and implications of such an intersection. Our investigation posits that LLMs can serve not only as an interpretive layer, allowing for the syntactically simplified manipulation of system models, but also as a catalyst for a knowledge-driven design approach. We highlight the efficiencies gained by deploying LLMs for SysML v2 interactions, which reduce the dependency on technical expertise traditionally needed for API navigation and model management. Through case studies and analysis, we demonstrate that the conversational engagement with system models facilitated by LLMs can lead to a democratized and accelerated design process. However, this advent is tempered by a critical awareness of potential pitfalls, such as automation bias and overreliance on automated systems?-underscoring the need for continued human oversight and the examination of ethical considerations. Emphasizing the chance of SysML v2 being inherently English-based and the parallel maturation of LLMs, this paper suggests that the collaborative utilization of these concurrent advancements may offer an opportune fusion, potentially revolutionizing the way systems are modeled and managed. Future work involves the empirical validation of these approaches and a deeper investigation into interoperability with existing and future systems engineering ecosystems.

Guariniello C.; Marsh T.B.; Porter R.; Crumbly C.; Delaurentis D.A.,Artificial Intelligence Agents to Support Data Mining for SoS Modeling of Space Systems Design,2020,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,9,"The complex and multidisciplinary nature of space systems and mission architectures is especially evident in early stage of design and architecting, where systems stakeholders have to keep into account all the aspects of a project, including alternatives, cost, risk, and schedule and evaluate various potentially conflicting metrics with a high level of uncertainty. Though aerospace engineering is a relatively young discipline, stakeholders in the field can rely on a vast body of knowledge and good practices for space systems design and architecting of space missions. These guidelines have been identified and refined over the years. However, the increase in size and complexity of applications in the aerospace discipline highlighted some gaps in this approach: first, the amount of available information is now very large and originates from multiple sources, often with diverse representations, and useful data for trade space analysis or analysis of all potential alternatives can be easily overlooked; second, the variety and complexity of the systems involved and of the different domains to be kept into account can generate unexpected interactions that cannot be easily identified; third, continuous advancements in the field of aerospace resulted in the development of new approaches and methodologies, for which a common knowledge database is not existing yet, thus requiring substantial effort upfront. To address these gaps and support both decision making in early stage of space systems design and increased automation in extraction of necessary data to feed working groups and analytical methodologies, we propose the training and use of Artificial Intelligence agents. These agents can be trained to recognize not only information coming from standardized representations, for example Model Based Systems Engineering diagrams, but also descriptions of systems and functionalities in plain English. This capability allows each agent to quantify the relevance of publications and documents to the query for which it is trained. At the same time, each agent can recognize potentially useful information in documents which are only loosely connected to the systems or functionalities on which the agent has been trained, and which would possibly be overlooked in a traditional literature review. The search for pertinent sources can be further refined using keywords, that let the user specify more details about the systems or functionality of interest, based on the intended use of the data. In this work we illustrate the use of Artificial Intelligent agents to sort space habitat subsystems into NASA Technology Roadmaps categories and to identify relevant sources of data for these subsystems. We demonstrate how the agents can support the retrieval of complex information required to feed existing System-of-Systems analytic tools and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps. ? 2020 IEEE.",\,Aerospace engineering; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Intelligent agents; NASA; Query processing; Search engines; Space applications; System of systems; Systems analysis; Analytical methodology; Artificial intelligence agent; Artificial intelligent; Complex information; Different domains; Literature reviews; Mission architectures; Model-based systems engineering; Data mining,"Purdue University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics 701 W.

System models provide a structured description of engineering data, whose inherent semantics often remains hard to explore. Natural language understanding, (i.e., the machine analysis of texts produced by humans) an important field of NLP, focuses on semantic text comprehension but cannot directly account for structured information sources. In this paper, we investigate natural language understanding of MBSE artifacts as they appear in industrial scenarios. In this context, the wide and heterogeneous knowledge space and user base calls for novel techniques to facilitate information retrieval from complex system models. We thus propose to leverage domain-specific text generators to transform models into a descriptive text corpus on which we apply state-of-the-art semantic search and analysis techniques.

Cibri¨¢n E.; ?lvarez-Rodr¨ªguez J.M.; Mendieta R.; Llorens J.,Towards a Method to Enable the Selection of Physical Models within the Systems Engineering Process: A Case Study with Simulink Models,2023,Applied Sciences,0,"The use of different techniques and tools is a common practice to cover all stages in the development life-cycle of systems generating a significant number of work products. These artefacts are frequently encoded using diverse formats, and often require access through non-standard protocols and formats. In this context, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) emerges as a methodology to shift the paradigm of Systems Engineering practice from a document-oriented environment to a model-intensive environment. To achieve this major goal, a formalised application of modelling is employed throughout the life-cycle of systems to generate various system artefacts represented as models, such as requirements, logical models, and multi-physics models. However, the mere use of models does not guarantee one of the main challenges in the Systems Engineering discipline, namely, the reuse of system artefacts. Considering the fact that models are becoming the main type of system artefact, it is necessary to provide the capability to properly and efficiently represent and retrieve the generated models. In light of this, traditional information retrieval techniques have been widely studied to match existing software assets according to a set of capabilities or restrictions. However, there is much more at stake than the simple retrieval of models or even any piece of knowledge. An environment for model reuse must provide the proper mechanisms to (1) represent any piece of data, information, or knowledge under a common and shared data model, and (2) provide advanced retrieval mechanisms to elevate the meaning of information resources from text-based descriptions to concept-based ones. This need has led to novel methods using word embeddings and vector-based representations to semantically encode information. Such methods are applied to encode the information of physical models while preserving their underlying semantics. In this study, a text corpus from MATLAB Simulink models was preprocessed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and trained to generate word vector representations. Then, the presented method was validated using a testbed of MATLAB Simulink physical models in which verbalisations of models are transformed into vectors. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was assessed through a use case study. Evaluation of the results demonstrates a precision value of 0.925, a recall value of 0.865, and an F1 score of 0.884. ? 2023 by the authors.",physical models; reuse models; semantic representation; similarity algorithm; word embedding,\,"E.

Yang L.; Cormican K.; Yu M.,Ontology Learning for Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge,2021,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,24,"Extant systems engineering standards are so fragmented that the conceptualization of a cohesive body of knowledge is not easy. The discrepancies between different standards lead to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, making communication between stakeholders increasingly difficult. Moreover, these standards remain document centric, whereas systems engineering is transforming from paper-based to a model-based discipline. This requires the use of advanced information exchange schema and digital artifacts to enhance interoperability. Ontologies have been advocated as a mechanism to address these problems, as they can support the model-based transition and formalize the domain knowledge. However, manually creating ontologies is a time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious process. Little has been known about how to automate the development and little work has been conducted for building systems engineering ontologies. Therefore, in this article, we propose an ontology learning methodology to extract a systems engineering ontology from the extant standards. This methodology employs natural language processing techniques to carry out the lexical and morphological analyses on the standard documents. From the learning process, important terminologies, synonyms, concepts, and relations constructing the systems engineering body of knowledge are automatically recognized and classified. A formal and sophisticated system engineering ontology is achieved, which can be used to harmonize the extant standards, unify the languages, and improve the interoperability of the model-based systems engineering approach.  ? 2005-2012 IEEE.",Knowledge acquisition; NLP; ontology; ontology engineering; ontology learning; systems engineering,Engineering education; Interoperability; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Systems engineering; Advanced informations; Engineering ontologies; Engineering standards; Model-based systems engineering; Morphological analysis; NAtural language processing; Sophisticated system; Systems engineering body of knowledge; Learning systems,"L.

Van Ruijven L.,Ontology for Systems Engineering as a base for MBSE,2015,INCOSE International Symposium,25,"This paper presents a method for creating a Systems Engineering ontology to enable Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). This method is based on creating a set of information models as defined in ISO 15926-11. ISO 15926 is a well-known life cycle data integration standard from the process industry. During the engineering phase of several capital facility projects, the method has also shown to be helpful in Systems Engineering communication between involved parties. Based on the information models and the set of relationships defined herein and in combination with a Reference Data Library (RDL), one can build or configure an information management system or data exchange mechanism to support Systems Engineering processes. The presented ontology has been validated in real projects based respectively on the software tool Relatics and on a RDF Named Graph application using a triple store. Experiences with the described ontology have shown that the topic of ontology is important for systems engineering and that there is merit in further examining the suitability of ISO 15288 as an ontological foundation, enabling formalized MBSE.",\,\,Croon Elektrotechniek B.V.

Orellana D.; Mandrick W.,The Ontology of Systems Engineering: Towards a Computational Digital Engineering Semantic Framework,2019,Procedia Computer Science,12,"The goal of implementing an enterprise digital engineering strategy is to improve data sharing throughout system conceptualization, development, manufacturing, operations, sustainment and their supporting organizations. Data sharing is a critical element of interoperability of models and other digital artifacts supporting the systems engineering process. Achieving interoperability within systems engineering requires eliminating differences of syntax and semantics to take advantage of automation, augmentation, and artificial intelligence capabilities that will increase process efficiency and artifact quality. This paper describes the development of a process-centric Systems Engineering (SE) reference ontology, based upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 Systems and Software Engineering - Life Cycle Processes [1]. The proposed SE reference ontology extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is a very small top-level ontology (TLO) designed specifically to support the integration of more specific ontologies that extend from it [2]. A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Basic Formal Ontology; Digital Engineering; Digital Thread; Information Content Entity; Knowledge Management; MBSE; Model-Based Systems Engineering; Ontology; Systems Engineering; Systems Modeling,Arts computing; Engineering research; Knowledge management; Life cycle; Ontology; Semantics; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Basic formal ontologies; Digital engineering; Digital Thread; Information contents; MBSE; Model-based systems engineering; Systems modeling; Interoperability,"D.
