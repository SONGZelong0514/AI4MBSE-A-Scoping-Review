Van Bossuyt D.L.; Hale B.; Arlitt R.; Papakonstantinou N.,Zero-Trust for the System Design Lifecycle,2023,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,"In an age of worsening global threat landscape and accelerating uncertainty, the design and manufacture of systems must increase resilience and robustness across both the system itself and the entire systems design process. We generally trust our colleagues after initial clearance/background checks; and systems to function as intended and within operating parameters after safety engineering review, verification, validation, and/ or system qualification testing. This approach has led to increased insider threat impacts; thus, we suggest moving to the ""trust, but verify""approach embodied by the Zero-Trust paradigm. Zero-Trust is increasingly adopted for network security but has not seen wide adoption in systems design and operation. Achieving the goal of Zero-Trust throughout the systems lifecycle will help to ensure that no single bad actor-whether human or machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)-can induce failure anywhere in a system's lifecycle. Additionally, while ML/AI and their associated risks are already entrenched within the operations phase of many systems' lifecycles, ML/AI is gaining traction during the design phase. For example, generative design algorithms are increasingly popular, but there is less understanding of potential risks. Adopting the Zero-Trust philosophy helps ensure robust and resilient design, manufacture, operations, maintenance, upgrade, and disposal of systems. We outline the rewards and challenges of implementing Zero-Trust and propose the framework for Zero-Trust for the system design lifecycle. This article highlights several areas of ongoing research with focus on high priority areas where the community should focus efforts. © 2023 by ASME.",artificial intelligence; cyber physical security for factories; cyber physical system design and operation; information management; machine learning for engineering applications; model-based systems engineering; system design; systems engineering; Zero-Trust,Scopus,"( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""ai"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""artificial intelligence"" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""mbse"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""model-based systems engineering"" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""review"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""survey"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""systematic"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""scoping"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""literature"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""state of the art"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""overview"" ) ) AND PUBYEAR > 2018 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND PUBYEAR > 2018 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , ""re"" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , ""ar"" ) )"
Zhang J.; Yang S.,Recommendations for the Model-Based Systems Engineering Modeling Process Based on the SysML Model and Domain Knowledge,2024,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a modeling approach used in industry to support the formalization, analysis, design, checking and verification of systems. In MBSE modeling, domain knowledge is the basis of the modeling. However, modeling does not happen overnight; it requires systematic training and a significant investment of resources. Unfortunately, many domain experts lack the expertise required for modeling, even though they know the domain well. The question arises about how to provide system modelers with domain knowledge at the right time to support the efficient completion of modeling. Since MBSE research that integrates AI is just beginning to take off, no public dataset is available. In this paper, aerospace SysML models are constructed based on spacecraft-related domain knowledge to form SysML model data. The validation rules are studied to validate the SysML model data, and combined with the concept of the recommended system, a recommendation method for the MBSE modeling process based on the knowledge and SysML model is proposed. A GLOVE language model is pre-trained by using domain knowledge and general knowledge; the model data are also used to fine-tune the GLOVE language model combined with the pre-training to recommend some domain development processes. The recommendation list is manually quality-verified and fed into the pre-training phase, while new requirement texts are continuously added in the fine-tuning phase, resulting in a more relevant and accurate recommendation list. Experiments show that the incremental recommender system can not only effectively recommend SysML models, but also improve the quality and efficiency of MBSE development. © 2024 by the authors.",domain modeling; MBSE; NLP; recommendation,Scopus,"( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""ai"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""artificial intelligence"" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""mbse"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""model-based systems engineering"" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""review"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""survey"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""systematic"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""scoping"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""literature"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""state of the art"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""overview"" ) ) AND PUBYEAR > 2018 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND PUBYEAR > 2018 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , ""re"" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , ""ar"" ) )"

Singh M.; Bansal S.; Vandana; Panigrahi B.K.; Garg A.,A Genetic Algorithm and RNN-LSTM Model for Remaining Battery Capacity Prediction,2022,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,"Li-ion batteries have diversified applications in everyday life. The temperature change, overcharging and over-discharging, is playing critical roles in affecting battery life in a significant manner. In this paper, the deep learning-based method is applied for the prognostics of a single Li-ion battery. The proposed design uses a recurrent neural network variant, long–short-term memory. The model’s parameters are optimized through a genetic algorithm-based parameter selector. The method applies to a sequence of data values comprising of the voltage, the charge capacity, the current, and the temperature. The estimation of battery capacity is not only based on the current or defined state of battery, instead, it is generated on the complete data profile. The robustness of the model is tested by comparing it with techniques such as support vector regressor, Kalman filter, and neural networks on normal and noisy test sets. The paper also proposes a feature selection and engineering scheme for battery capacity prediction. The proposed model outperforms the techniques available in the literature with high generalization to noise and other perturbations. The model is independent of the section of the charging curve used for the prediction of battery capacity. Various experimentation has been conducted on the model and the; results have been validated. © 2022 by ASME.",artificial intelligence; big data and analytics; data-driven engineering; model-based systems engineering; process modeling for engineering applications,Scopus,"( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""ai"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""artificial intelligence"" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""mbse"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""model-based systems engineering"" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""review"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""survey"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""systematic"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""scoping"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""literature"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""state of the art"" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""overview"" ) ) AND PUBYEAR > 2018 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND PUBYEAR > 2018 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , ""re"" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , ""ar"" ) )"

Technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-fidelity modeling and simulation have been studied to further the digitalization of the nuclear industry. In this paper, an overview of the DT initiatives and developments for the design optimization and intelligent transformation of nuclear energy systems is described to provide a development trend of DT technology for nuclear reactors. For the design of DT for complex systems such as nuclear reactors, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) technology offers requirements models, design processes, and system verification that are clearer, more precise, and more comprehensive.

Traditional design methods often utilize text-based approaches to model systems; however, such documentation-based designs often suffer from semantic heterogeneity, inconsistent data sources, and also struggle to provide a more intuitive overview of the overall design process. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method based on ontology-knowledge collaborative drive to achieve integration of the overall EMU design. Firstly, we employ the System Modeling Language (SysML) to construct the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) model of the EMU, establishing functional and physical architecture element models, with the EMU MBSE model serving as input. Subsequently, in the requirement model, architecture model, and traceability model, we utilize top-level ontology to construct the EMU ontology framework in a top-down manner. Lastly, leveraging the Neo4j database, we employ a knowledge graph (KG) approach to fill domain knowledge into each model in a bottom-up manner, thereby realizing the ontology-knowledge collaborative drive for the overall EMU design construction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the EMU Passenger Information System (PIS) and Traction transformer System (TS) as examples.",EMU overall design; model-based systems engineering; meta-model; ontology; knowledge graph,Web of Science,"(TS=(""ai"") OR TS=(""artificial intelligence"")) AND (TS=(""mbse"") OR TS=(""model-based systems engineering"")) AND ( TS=(""review"") OR TS=(""survey"") OR TS=(""systematic"") OR TS=(""scoping"") OR TS=(""literature"") OR TS=(""state of the art"") OR TS=(""overview"")) AND PY=2019-2024"

"Rosa, Maiara; Wang, Wei Min; Stark, Rainer; Rozenfeld, Henrique",A concept map to support the planning and evaluation of artifacts in the initial phases of PSS design,2021,RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,"Designing Product-Service Systems (PSS) is associated with multiple problems and challenges, usually derived from its multidisciplinarity and partially intangible nature. One particular issue is the high likelihood of ignoring the creation of relevant information regarding one or more PSS elements during the early design phases. Proceeding to later stages (e.g., detailed design) without generating the required information regarding all PSS elements and their relationships may lead to rework and lack of integration. Dealing with this problem requires adequate planning and evaluation of the artifacts (such as documents and models) created in the initial design phases. As a fundamental theoretical basis to support the creation of solutions that may help project managers dealing with this challenge, this paper presents a concept map to structure the concepts that compose artifacts resulting from the initial stages of PSS design and how those concepts interrelate. This concept map aims to structure which classes of information should be defined in the early phases of the design process before proceeding to a detailed design. The concept map was created by extracting concepts and relationships proposed in classifications, taxonomies, ontologies, meta-models, and concept maps in the PSS and servitization fields. Those documents were identified through a comprehensive systematic literature review. The resulting concept map was verified for completeness against formal documentation of two retrospective PSS design projects. The final proposed concept map is composed of 143 concepts interconnected through 278 relationships. In its current format, the concept map may be used as a checklist to support project managers in planning and evaluating early phases of PSS design based on information completeness. Researchers may also employ it to deploy ontologies, approach further knowledge and information-related challenges in PSS design, or structure PSS-related model-based systems engineering approaches. In future research, this concept map shall be deployed in a meta-model based on artifacts commonly used in PSS design, structuring a computational tool to allow and support practical application on planning and evaluating PSS design projects.",Concept map; Ontology; PSS design; Knowledge management; Planning; Evaluation,Web of Science,"(TS=(""ai"") OR TS=(""artificial intelligence"")) AND (TS=(""mbse"") OR TS=(""model-based systems engineering"")) AND ( TS=(""review"") OR TS=(""survey"") OR TS=(""systematic"") OR TS=(""scoping"") OR TS=(""literature"") OR TS=(""state of the art"") OR TS=(""overview"")) AND PY=2019-2024"
"Lopez, Jose Antonio Hernandez; Cuadrado, Jesus Sanchez",Generating Structurally Realistic Models With Deep Autoregressive Networks,2023,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,"Model generators are important tools in model-based systems engineering to automate the creation of software models for tasks like testing and benchmarking. Previous works have established four properties that a generator should satisfy: consistency, diversity, scalability, and structural realism. Although several generators have been proposed, none of them is focused on realism. As a result, automatically generated models are typically simple and appear synthetic. This work proposes a new architecture for model generators which is specifically designed to be structurally realistic. Given a dataset consisting of several models deemed as real models, this type of generators is able to produce new models which are structurally similar to the models in the dataset, but are fundamentally novel models. Our implementation, named ModelMime (M2), is based on a deep autoregressive model which combines a Graph Neural Network with a Recurrent Neural Network. We decompose each model into a sequence of edit operations, and the neural network is trained in the task of predicting the next edit operation given a partial model. At inference time, the system produces new models by sampling edit operations and iteratively completing the model. We have evaluated M2 with respect to three state-of-the-art generators, showing that 1) our generator outperforms the others in terms of the structurally realistic property 2) the models generated by M2 are most of the time consistent, 3) the diversity of the generated models is at least the same as the real ones and, 4) the generation process is scalable once the generator is trained.",Model generators; realistic models; graph neural networks; recurrent neural networks; generative models,Web of Science,"(TS=(""ai"") OR TS=(""artificial intelligence"")) AND (TS=(""mbse"") OR TS=(""model-based systems engineering"")) AND ( TS=(""review"") OR TS=(""survey"") OR TS=(""systematic"") OR TS=(""scoping"") OR TS=(""literature"") OR TS=(""state of the art"") OR TS=(""overview"")) AND PY=2019-2024"

As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods.

We conduct a review of the last twelve years and find that MBSE adoption in HSs is accelerating, with use of various MBSE languages and tools, as well as their integration with other simulation and modeling techniques. We find that similar to engineered systems, the most common MBSE language is systems modeling language (SysML), followed by unified modeling language (UML) and others. Additionally, we observe that MBSE methods are frequently used in conjunction with other analytical techniques, such as simulation and co-simulations, to analyze and enhance various HS operations, or to assist with making tradeoffs between HS attributes such as quality and cost. Moreover, we provide a non-exhaustive classification of current research based on two dimensions: healthcare applications and MBSE use cases. Notably, MBSE is being implemented generally with patient-centric objectives in various HS domains, including IoT-enabled smart healthcare, clinical medicine, medical device development, healthcare process enhancement, and healthcare facilities management. While the primary MBSE use case involves modeling different aspects of healthcare operations, there is a significant number of studies that pursue requirements engineering, systems analysis, integration, verification and validation, as well as risk analysis and management. Furthermore, we identify two promising research gaps. First, there is a need for the integration of MBSE with state-of-the-art data-driven analytical methodologies such as hybrid simulation and artificial intelligence techniques. Second, HSs could greatly benefit from representing the cognitive functions and processes of human decision-makers in the loop, such as healthcare providers (e.g., doctors and nurses), who are instrumental in sustaining the HS performance and functionality.

Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) significantly influence traffic flows at intersections. Therefore, adaptive TSCSs (ATSCSs) that can adjust to traffic conditions in real-time have been proposed as more efficient alternatives. However, the expensive implementation of these systems highlights the need for judicious investments in appropriate technologies and infrastructure. Therefore, a comprehensive technology roadmap should be built that guides the future development of traffic control and the infusion of technologies to address traffic needs. Additionally, as ATSCSs are developed and managed by local governments, the perspective of a government-led technology roadmap is required to guide the roadmap development and implementation. Although studies have explored technology roadmaps across numerous sectors, the viewpoint of roadmap development guided by government entities is frequently neglected despite the role of these entities in shaping technological policies, underwriting research and development initiatives, and driving nationwide innovation strategies. In this study, a comprehensive framework is proposed for developing technology roadmaps tailored for systems and technologies led by governmental entities. This framework has been adapted from the Advanced Technology Roadmap Architecture (ATRA) and brought original adjustments thereby addressing the research gap. The study also presents strategic recommendations for the ATSCS implementation in South Korea, integrating systems engineering principles for a holistic approach to technological advancements.

"Dullen, Shawn; Verma, Dinesh; Blackburn, Mark; Whitcomb, Cliff",Survey on set-based design (SBD) quantitative methods,2021,Systems Engineering,"Product development efforts now more than ever are in need of methodologies that can address the challenges of increased system complexities, shortening time to market, increased demands in mass customization, market instabilities, geographical barriers, improved innovation, and adaptability to emerging technologies. To address these challenges most companies will need to make key decisions early in the product development life-cycle. In this early phase there are high levels of information uncertainty and information ambiguity. Under these circumstances many companies will converge too early to a point design (Point Based Design?PBD) which will lead to increased cost and schedule delays due to reworking the design later in the product development life cycle. To overcome these challenges many researchers have proposed the Set-Based Design (SBD) methodology. However, there has been limited guidance on how to define, reason, and narrow sets while improving the level of abstraction of the design. To address such concerns, a literature review was conducted. The contributions of this research include: (1) aggregated literature from over 100 sources on quantitative methods (QM) that has not been considered SBD but does support set-based thinking, (2) consolidated body of knowledge on QM to help industrial practitioners implement SBD, (3) ?defined gaps and opportunities for future research, and (4) defined strengths and limitations of QM and techniques to define, reason and narrow sets.",design space exploration; lean product and process development; new product development; set-based concurrent engineering; set-based design; systems engineering; trade-off analysis,Wiley Online Library,"""( ai ) OR ( ""artificial intelligence"" )"" anywhere and ""(mbse) OR (""model-based systems engineering"")"" anywhere and ""(""review"" OR ""survey"" OR ""systematic"" OR ""scoping"" OR ""literature"" OR ""state of the art"" OR ""overview"")"" in Title"
