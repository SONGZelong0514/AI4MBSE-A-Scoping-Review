Same approach has been used for the Camera-System itself. The complete flow-down of requirements has been created in order to easily identify and monitor any impact on the design due to changes, deviations and non-compliances. The model can be updated at any time importing Excel spreadsheet while it can be used as source to export documentation needed during formal reviews, both as Word and Excel files.

Organizations implementing model-based systems engineering practices into their product development processes can leverage on ontologies, models, and procedures to enhance LLMs applied to engineering design tasks. We present a methodology to integrate an Object-Process Methodology model of a space system into an LLMbased spacecraft design assistant and show a performance improvement, as compared to a conventional LLM. The benchmark is evaluated through subjective expert-assessed and an objective cosine-similarity-based criteria. The results motivate additional efforts in integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering practice into LLMs as means to improve their performance and reduce shortcomings such as hallucinations and black-box, untraceable behavior. ? 2024 by SCITEPRESS 每 Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",\,,"Science and Technology Publications, Lda",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Mullis J.; Chen C.; Morkos B.; Ferguson S.,Deep Neural Networks in Natural Language Processing for Classifying Requirements by Origin and Functionality: An Application of BERT in System Requirements,2024,Journal of Mechanical Design,4,"Given the foundational role of system requirements in design projects, designers can benefit from classifying, comparing, and observing connections between requirements. Manually undertaking these processes, however, can be laborious and time-consuming. Previous studies have employed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) deep neural network model, to automatically analyze written requirements. Yet, it remains unclear whether BERT can sufficiently capture the nuances that differentiate requirements between and within design documents. This work evaluates BERT's performance on two requirement classification tasks (one inter- document and one intra-document) executed on a corpus of 1,303 requirements sourced from five system design projects. First, in the ""parent document classification""task, a BERT model is fine-tuned to classify requirements according to their originating project. A separate BERT model is then fine-tuned on a ""functional classification""task where each requirement is classified as either functional or nonfunctional. Our results also include a comparison with a baseline model, Word2Vec, and demonstrate that our model achieves higher classification accuracy. When evaluated on test sets, the former model receives a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.95, while the latter receives an MCC of 0.82, indicating BERT's ability to reliably distinguish requirements. This work then explores the application of BERT's representations, known as embeddings, to identify similar requirements and predict requirement change.  ? 2023 by ASME.",Computer aided design; Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Neural network models; Requirements engineering; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Classification tasks; Design automations; Design programs; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Requirement management; Requirements classifications; System requirements; Deep neural networks,"B.

The choices that are made have a high impact on the required investment when creating the twin, most notably on the development time and deployment cost. This is especially true when multiple iterations are needed to find the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction and detail, architecture, technologies and tools.

While this expectation is relatively straightforward, the question of how to get there is less obvious. The multi-dimensional and intricate nature of sustainability poses challenges in designing sustainable systems and analyzing sustainability properties.

Bader E.; Vereno D.; Neureiter C.,Facilitating User-Centric Model-Based Systems Engineering Using Generative AI,2024,International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development,0,"The increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems requires model-based systems engineering (MBSE) in an effort to sustain a comprehensive oversight. However, broader adaptation of these models requires specialized knowledge and training. In order to make this process more user-friendly, the concept of user-centric systems engineering emerged. Artificial intelligence (AI) could help users overcome beginner hurdles and leverage their contribution quality. This research investigates the feasibility of a large language model in the systems engineering context, with a particular emphasis on the identification of potential obstacles for similar tasks. Therefore, a GPT model is trained on a dataset consisting of UML component diagram elements. In conclusion, the promising results of this research justify utilizing AI in MBSE. Complex relationships between the UML elements were not only understood, they were also generated using natural-language text. Problems arise from the extensive nature of the XMI, the context limitation and the unique identifiers of the UML elements. The fine-tuning process enabled the LLM to gain valuable insights into UML modeling while transferring their base knowledge, which is a promising step toward reducing complexity in MBSE. ? 2024 by SCITEPRESS 每 Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",\,,"Science and Technology Publications, Lda",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
J迆nior F.S.; Reis P.A.; Cavalcante M.S.; De Oliveira A.H.M.,Systems Engineering Process Enhancement: Requirements Verification Methodology using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Automotive Industry,2024,SAE Technical Papers,0,"More sophisticated vehicle features to improve user experience and safety in the Automotive Industry applications have significantly increased the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) over the years. These changes were followed by the increased complexity in technical solutions for Embedded Software and interfaces among the ECUs. In this context, Systems Engineering (SE) plays a key role to achieve robustness on definition and implementation of complex systems. The overall system is broken down into lower functions associated to a specific use case, considering user's input and the expected outputs, in three different abstraction levels - Concept, Logic and Technology. Those functions are described with structure and behavior diagrams and requirements using SysML (Systems Modelling Language), which enables the entire system simulation and validation before being cascaded to ECUs Software implementation team during the Product Development process through Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools. On this scope, the requirements have a vital role inside Systems Engineering methodology because it is the statement which defines the system required functionalities, performance, constraints, and other characteristics that satisfy stakeholders and costumers needs. The SysML diagrams are built based on the defined system requirements and many times this is a very iterative process, time-consuming and error-prone task until satisfying every required function logic and conditions. When the requirements are poorly defined, these can lead to project failure. Therefore, requirements must be unambiguous, verifiable, and traceable through Systems Engineering lifecycle. By using Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) template, Systems Engineers have specific words to standardize the requirements, accomplishing with EARS requests such as ""When,""""While,""""Where,""""If""to mention the stimulus or pre-conditions, ""Then""to call the function/product and ""shall""representing the action to be taken. In addition, by using the rules proposed by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), Systems Engineers can improve the robustness of the requirement by avoiding, for example, words that may be misinterpreted during the system modeling and development process. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to improve process flow by automating requirement verification. NLP techniques will be responsible for mapping and processing the text data in the system requirements based on actions, preconditions, functions, and triggers to improve the quality and robustness of the developed requirements. By Applying NLP algorithms, this paper aims to consolidate a more robust methodology to verify the system requirements, based on EARS template and INCOSE rules, prior to SysML diagrams development, which improves the final overall system implementation to satisfy the stakeholders and customer needs.  ? 2021 SAE International.",Automotive industry; Computer circuits; Computer software; Control systems; Data handling; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Requirements engineering; Condition; Electronics control unit; Language processing; Natural languages; Process enhancements; Requirement verifications; System engineering process; System engineers; System models; System requirements; Modeling languages,,SAE International,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Khurana S.; Dev A.; Bansal P.,"ADAM optimised human speech emotion recogniser based on statistical information distribution of chroma, MFCC, and MBSE features",2024,Multimedia Tools and Applications,1,"The textual or display-based control paradigm in human每computer interaction (HCI) has changed in favor of more natural control modalities like voice and gesture. Speech, in particular, contains a significant deal of information, revealing the speaker's inner state and intention. While word analysis makes understanding the speaker's request possible, other speech aspects reveal the speaker's attitude, goal, and motivation. As a result, it is now crucial for modern human每computer interface systems to recognize emotions from speech. Numerous techniques for sound analysis have been created in the past. This work aims to detect human emotions from their voice snippet; for this, an English language open source dataset Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) and Hindi-language dataset IITKGP-SEHSC are used. RAVDESS contains over 2000 voice samples recorded by 24 actors covering eight emotions: anger, fear, neutral, calmness, happiness, sadness, disgust, and surprise. The proposed model uses ADAM optimized deep learning model along with MFCC, chroma, and Mel band spectral energy features (MBSE) to classify and recognize eight different human vocal emotions. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is used for classification. The efficiency of the proposed model was compared to another state of the art, and the outcomes were assessed. Using the proposed structure of the model on the RAVDESS and IITKGP-SEHSC datasets, an overall accuracy of 85.19% and 80%, respectively, were achieved. ?

Zhang J.; Yang S.,Recommendations for the Model-Based Systems Engineering Modeling Process Based on the SysML Model and Domain Knowledge,2024,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),0,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a modeling approach used in industry to support the formalization, analysis, design, checking and verification of systems. In MBSE modeling, domain knowledge is the basis of the modeling. However, modeling does not happen overnight; it requires systematic training and a significant investment of resources. Unfortunately, many domain experts lack the expertise required for modeling, even though they know the domain well. The question arises about how to provide system modelers with domain knowledge at the right time to support the efficient completion of modeling. Since MBSE research that integrates AI is just beginning to take off, no public dataset is available. In this paper, aerospace SysML models are constructed based on spacecraft-related domain knowledge to form SysML model data. The validation rules are studied to validate the SysML model data, and combined with the concept of the recommended system, a recommendation method for the MBSE modeling process based on the knowledge and SysML model is proposed. A GLOVE language model is pre-trained by using domain knowledge and general knowledge; the model data are also used to fine-tune the GLOVE language model combined with the pre-training to recommend some domain development processes. The recommendation list is manually quality-verified and fed into the pre-training phase, while new requirement texts are continuously added in the fine-tuning phase, resulting in a more relevant and accurate recommendation list. Experiments show that the incremental recommender system can not only effectively recommend SysML models, but also improve the quality and efficiency of MBSE development. ? 2024 by the authors.",\,"S.

Rebelo Moreira J.L.,The Role of Interoperability for Digital Twins,2024,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2,"The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has gained popularity as a digital representation of physical entities that interact with their real-world counterparts in (near) real-time through sensors and actuators. DTs can be applied across different sectors, offering benefits like simulation, remote monitoring, and predictive maintenance, which are relevant capabilities of smart systems. However, achieving the full potential of DTs requires addressing interoperability challenges posed by the complex networks of devices and systems that play different roles in DTs. This paper presents a research agenda aimed at enhancing DT interoperability grounded in four perspectives, which reflect knowledge fields in computer/information science, i.e., architecture of distributed systems, model-based system engineering, ontology-driven conceptual modeling, and linked data with semantic web. This paper highlights how leveraging on existing standards, such as modelling languages and ontologies, is important for improved DT interoperability.

To tackle this issue, the Confiance.ai research program intends to provide a methodological end-to-end engineering approach and a set of relevant tools. Against this background, an MBSE approach is proposed to establish the methodological guidelines and to structure a tooled workbench consistently. In this approach, the system of interest is referred to as the ""Trustworthiness Environment"" (i.e. the Confiance.ai workbench). The approach is an adaptation of the Arcadia method and hence built around four perspectives: Operational Analysis (the engineering methods and processes: the operational need around the Trustworthiness Environment), System Analysis (the functions of the Trustworthiness Environment), Logical Architecture and Physical Architecture (abstract and concrete resources of the Trustworthiness Environment). Given the current progress of the Confiance.ai program, this paper focuses particularly on the Operational Analysis, leading to the modeling of engineering activities and processes.

The approach can customize the GPT-4 model with an activity metamodel specified in Eclipse Ecore or predefined activity diagrams encoded in a textual format for learning from instances. Alternatively, the descriptive text from the LLM can be provided as input to a parser, resulting in an activity that can be readily transformed into a discrete event system specification (DEVS) model with simulation capability. We will discuss how the process can be enhanced in a simulation environment, thus offering the opportunity to examine a variety of scenarios and arguments for incorporating generative AI or general AI as a collaborative agent in the domain of interest.

Consequently, intelligent approaches have to be developed to manage these models, including comparing, clone detection, analyzing, and searching for similarity. There are obstacles and restrictions when using machine learning algorithms on models because of their special structure. While these models comprise graph structures, they also contain textual information. Both of these features must be considered to perform more accurate learning. This paper explores the challenges associated with this area of study and discusses potential solutions. Since comparison is the basis of many learning algorithms, it is imperative that the data in this category be prepared in a fashion suitable for comparison. In this sense, the text and structural aspects of embedding meta-models (as one of the popular techniques in the model's world) techniques are assessed, and an approach for combining both aspects is suggested.

Jamil A.; Dinh T.; De Paepe W.; Somehsaraei H.N.,THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS WITH A SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH FOR DATA ENHANCEMENT IN HUMIDIFIED MICRO-GAS TURBINE APPLICATION,2024,Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,0,"Globally the energy sector is being transformed by innovations based on decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. These encompass transitioning towards a future with distributed generation systems having an increased share of renewables, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. Micro-gas turbines are a competitive enabling technology in distributed power generation owing to benefits like fuel flexibility, reduced operation and maintenance costs, and emissions. However, its economic performance stumbles when not running in combined heat and power mode, requiring cycle modifications to increase electrical efficiency. The humidified micro-gas turbine is one such modification that shows great potential. For its viability in digitalized future energy systems with ever-growing amounts of data, there needs to be reliable and deployable advanced tools for performance and health management. This requires access to sufficient quality data, making data quality management an essential need. Therefore, the study presented in this paper investigates the use of a special type of artificial neural network called an autoencoder for data enhancement of a humidified micro-gas turbine. Data from 15 sensors has been enhanced by denoising for use in any subsequent data-driven insight and decision. To achieve this, different neural network models have been developed and compared to predict the denoised values. The auto-encoder network model that can best produce satisfactory denoised results has been identified as having 3 bottleneck and 6 mapping layer nodes. Furthermore, a systems engineering framework has been adopted for effective information and complexity management amongst all stakeholders. The framework sets a foundation for employing model-based systems engineering concepts in developing digital solutions. The results demonstrate the functionality of deploying denoising autoencoders with a systems engineering approach for data quality management of the humidified micro-gas turbine. The outcomes from this work can be used for data-driven performance and health management of the humidified micro-gas turbine. This will improve the system＊s reliability and promote its use in energy systems of the future.

Given the central role of software in modern cyber-physical systems and the increasing adoption of digital engineering practices in complex systems design, there is now significant opportunity for collaborative design among system users, software developers, and systems engineers. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and systems modeling languages can support seamless cross-domain connectivity for design, simulation, and analysis of emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR). This paper presents a co-design process for extending the capability of an existing AR application referred to as a No-Code AR Systems (NCARS) framework. NCARS enables content developed by multi-domain authors to be deployed on AR devices through a software layer that bridges the content to the game engine that drives the AR system. Utilizing a software dependency diagram of the AR Annotation function, an existing MBSE model of the AR system is extended to include the structure and behavior of relevant software components. This allows a modular design of the system to address needs in integrating new requirements into the existing application. New user requirements for tracking items in motion in the user's physical environment with virtual annotations in the augmented space are collaboratively designed and visualized through use case, block definition, internal block, and sequence diagrams. They capture the required structure and behavior of the proposed to-be system.  ? 2024 IEEE.",Application programs; Design; Embedded systems; Modeling languages; Systems analysis; Augmented reality applications; Augmented reality systems; Digital transformation; Dynamic annotation; Human-centric designs; Item tracking; Model-based system engineerings; Role of software; Software and systems engineerings; Systems engineering model; Augmented reality,; ; ; ; ,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,
Peer J.; Mordecai Y.; Reich Y.,NLP4ReF: Requirements Classification and Forecasting: From Model-Based Design to Large Language Models,2024,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,0,"We introduce Natural Language Processing for Requirement Forecasting (NLP4ReF), a model-based machine learning and natural language processing solution for enhancing the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. RE continues to face significant challenges and demands innovative approaches for process efficiency. Traditional RE methods relying on natural language struggle with incomplete, hidden, forgotten, and evolving requirements during and after the critical design review, risking project failures and setbacks. NLP4ReF tackles several key challenges: a) distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements, b) classification of requirements by their respective system classes, and c) generation of unanticipated requirements to enhance project success. NLP4ReF employs a common natural language toolkit (NLTK) package and the recently-trending Chat-GPT. We tested NLP4ReF on PROMISE_exp, a pre-existing dataset with 1000 software requirements, and PROMISE_IoT, an enhanced dataset with 2000 software and IoT requirements. We validated NLP4ReF on a genuine IoT project. NLP4ReF swiftly generated dozens of new requirements, verified by a team of systems engineers, of which over 70% were crucial for project success. We found that GPT is superior in authentic requirement generation, while NLTK excels at requirement classification. NLP4ReF offers significant time saving, effort reduction, and improved future-proofing.

Bouhali I.; Idasiak V.; Martinez J.; Mhenni F.; Choley J.-Y.; Palladino L.; Kratz F.,A Collaboration Framework Using Digital Twin for Dynamic Simulation and Requirements Verification Based on MBSE and the MIC Concept,2024,"SysCon 2024 - 18th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, Proceedings",0,"Thanks to their clarity, the use of system models is increasingly widespread in industry, providing engineers with the means of traceability, and reducing ambiguities. Systems engineers use an MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) approach to describe different views of a system (requirements, operational view, functional view, behavioral view, logical and physical architecture views). The system model is useful to design the system architecture in either a static or a dynamic perspective. The first step in systems engineering is the requirements specification. This is an important step in the development phase, since the system must satisfy the defined requirements (functional and physical), to be able to choose the right architecture solution. Many trade-off methods exist: in some cases, it is sufficient to use parametric diagrams to calculate the system performances based on the functional causality of the system, and to execute simulations in the system modeler tool. However, there are some performances that need a more complex dynamic model requiring, for instance, differential equations, as well as a suitable solver, in a dedicated simulation tool, especially when the system is a complex mechatronic system, that needs multiphysics simulation. Many industries have adopted the digital twin (DT) concept in their activities, because of its fidelity and precision. It is highly recommended to use DT models during the early phases of development in order to verify system requirements, with a view to reducing development costs [18]. It is then necessary to ensure digital thread between system models and DT simulation models. To address these issues, this paper presents a collaboration methodology between simulation engineers and system engineers. The aim is to achieve earlier requirements verification and trade-off decisions. In order to fulfill these objectives, it is necessary to ensure the traceability of models changes and to reduce the probability of miss-understandings. For this reason, the MIC (Model Identity Card) concept is used in the proposed methodology.  ? 2024 IEEE.",Architecture; Differential equations; Economic and social effects; Engineers; Microwave integrated circuits; Identity cards; Model identity card; Model-based system engineerings; Requirement; Requirement verifications; Simulation; System engineers; System models; System requirements; Trade off; Memory architecture,"I.

Gagliardi M.; Hause M.,"How Did General Veers Get His AT-AT? Product Line Engineering (PLE), of Course!",2024,SAE Technical Papers,0,"MBSE and architecture frameworks were created to help systems engineers cope with the complexity of systems and systems of systems (SoS). Using these modeling languages, systems engineers can define the system, its context, connecting systems, internal components and behaviors, constraints, how the system changes over time, etc. However, when dealing with a family of systems or a product line of systems, one needs to understand the system variability, common components and behavior across the product line. This can decrease costs for development, maintenance, supply chains, and shorten development lifecycles. Product Line Engineering (PLE) is the engineering and management of a group of related products using a shared set of assets and a means of design and manufacturing. PLE can include system and software assets and involves all aspects of engineering including electrical, electronic, mechanical, chemical, etc. Model-based Product Line Engineering combines the best of MBSE and PLE. Using an example system from Star Wars, this paper will describe MB-PLE, the process for creating product lines, and the benefits of this approach as applicable to the military ground vehicle domain. Finally, it will show how the adoption of MB-PLE provides analysis of alternatives for candidate architectures.  ?

Milind T.R.; Thomas A.; Rastogi S.; Satyadeep K.,"System Level Modelling, Evaluation, and Trade-Off/Optimization of Solid-State & Hybrid DC Circuit Breakers for an EV Eco-System Using AI/ML in an MBSE Framework",2024,SAE Technical Papers,0,"With the increasing demand for efficient & clean transport solutions, applications such as road transport vehicles, aerospace and marine are seeing a rise in electrification at a significant rate. Irrespective of industries, the main source of power that enables electrification in mobility applications like electric vehicles (EV), electric ships and electrical vertical take-off & landing (e-VTOL) is primarily a battery making it fundamentally a DC system. Fast charging solutions for EVs & e-VTOLs are also found to be DC in nature because of several advantages like ease of integration, higher efficiency, etc. Likewise, the key drivers of the electric grid are resulting in an energy transition towards renewable sources, that are also essentially DC in nature. Overall, these different business trends with their drivers appear to be converging towards DC power systems, making it pertinent. However, DC circuit protection poses serious challenges compared to AC due to the absence of natural zero-crossing points and the high rise rate of fault current demanding the need for fast-acting protective devices. Circuit breakers as protective devices are advantageous because of their resettable feature. This has prompted engineers to look beyond their conventional purview and explore developments in mechanical technologies of fast-acting switches & power electronics technologies to develop circuit protection solutions for DC systems. The result has been the development of solid-state circuit breakers (SSCB) and hybrid circuit breakers (HCB), making their design and analysis crucial. Thus, this paper focuses primarily on the model-based analysis of SSCB & HCB used for DC circuit protection in mobility applications. System-level models of the breakers are developed and integrated with a DC power distribution system. Key critical to quality (CTQs) of the design like response time, power loss, temperature rise, rate of rise of fault current, current commutation, and drop in DC bus voltage are predicted. Also, sensitivity to design parameters is analyzed. As there are a variety of architectures for these breakers, a Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) approach is adopted to have an ideal framework for tracking and evaluating different architectures. Further, a Machine Learning (ML) based Reduced-Order Model (ROM) is developed, embedded in the MBSE framework for quick model-based sensitivity and optimization studies for faster product-to-market without compromising on accuracy. ? 2024 Eaton Intelligent Power, Ltd.",Electric circuit breakers; Electric network analysis; Electric ship equipment; Electric utilities; Power quality; Timing circuits; Circuit protection; Circuit-breakers; D.C Circuit; DC circuits; DC system; Engineering frameworks; Machine-learning; Model-based system engineerings; Power; System-level modeling; Economic and social effects,,SAE International,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

However, for novel systems, relevant data available is limited. In this work, we propose a framework informing model-based mission assurance activities with historical incident reports, lessons learned, or other relevant engineering documents using natural language processing. In doing so, we investigate whether there is useful information in data sets that are relevant, if not identical, to the system under design and whether, through rigorous systems engineering practice, this information can be effectively leveraged through model-based failure analysis. In a worked case study, we apply state-of-the-art topic modeling techniques to two data sets, a mission relevant data set and a system relevant data set. The sets of topics are merged and interpreted to form a preliminary list of failure topics that can be used to inform the identification of off-nominal modes in the model-based failure modes and effects analysis development. Once data from the system in operation is available, it can be used to update the topics identified. By extracting information about likely failures from relevant historical data sets and utilizing model-based mission assurance to ensure relevance and rigor, unanticipated failures can be reduced, and projects can more effectively learn from past missions. ? 2024 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The main purpose is to analyse how MBSE tools can be used for enhancing design and development. processes with special emphasis on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). The use of digital technologies in the design process of complex systems expands the possibilities and ambitions of technological solutions. A complex system seeks to solve problems that address multiple areas of knowledge. For its design, collaboration in multidisciplinary teams is essential. The increase in the scope of projects makes it essential to formalize the integration of partial solutions in a System of Systems (SoS) that solves the general problem consistently and cohesively.

Mao X.; Sen C.,Formal Qualitative Physics-Based Reasoning for Functional Decomposition of Engineered Systems,2024,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,1,"Functional decomposition is an important task in early systems engineering and design, where the overall function of the system is resolved into the functions of its components or subassemblies. Conventionally, this task is performed manually, because of the possibility of multiple solution paths and the need for understanding the physics phenomena that could realize the desired effects. To this end, this paper presents a formal method for functional decomposition using physics-based qualitative reasoning. The formal representation includes three parts: (1) a natural language lexicon that can be used to detect the changes of physical states of material and energy flows, (2) a set of causation tables that abstracts the knowledge of qualitative physics by capturing the causal relations between the various quantities involved in a physical phenomenon or process, and (3) a process-To-subgraph mapping that translates the physical processes to function structure constructs. The algorithms use the above three representations and some additional topological reasoning to synthesize and assemble function structure graphs that are decompositions of a given black box model. The paper presents the formal representations and reasoning algorithms and illustrates this method using an example function model of an air-heating device. It also presents the software implementation of the representations and the algorithms and uses it to validate the method's ability to generate multiple decompositions from a black-box function model. ? 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Traditional design methods often utilize text-based approaches to model systems; however, such documentation-based designs often suffer from semantic heterogeneity, inconsistent data sources, and also struggle to provide a more intuitive overview of the overall design process. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method based on ontology每knowledge collaborative drive to achieve integration of the overall EMU design. Firstly, we employ the System Modeling Language (SysML) to construct the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) model of the EMU, establishing functional and physical architecture element models, with the EMU MBSE model serving as input. Subsequently, in the requirement model, architecture model, and traceability model, we utilize top-level ontology to construct the EMU ontology framework in a top-down manner. Lastly, leveraging the Neo4j database, we employ a knowledge graph (KG) approach to fill domain knowledge into each model in a bottom-up manner, thereby realizing the ontology每knowledge collaborative drive for the overall EMU design construction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the EMU Passenger Information System (PIS) and Traction transformer System (TS) as examples. ? 2024 by the authors.",Integrated circuit design; Ontology; Design-process; Electric multiple unit; Electric multiple unit overall design; Knowledge graphs; Meta model; Metamodeling; Model-based system engineerings; Ontology's; Overall design; Unit design; Knowledge graph,"L.

Sultan B.; Apvrille L.,AI-Driven Consistency of SysML Diagrams,2024,Proceedings - MODELS 2024: ACM/IEEE 27th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,0,"Graphical modeling languages, expected to simplify systems analysis and design, present a challenge in maintaining consistency across their varied views. Traditional rule-based methods for ensuring consistency in languages like UML often fall short in addressing complex semantic dimensions. Moreover, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Model Driven Engineering (MDE) introduces additional consistency challenges, as LLM＊s limited output contexts requires the integration of responses. This paper presents a new framework that automates the detection and correction of inconsistencies across different views, leveraging formally defined rules and incorporating OpenAI＊s GPT, as implemented in TTool. Focusing on the consistency between use case and block diagrams, the framework is evaluated through its application to three case studies, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance consistency management in graphical modeling. ? 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Systems analysis; Visual languages; Block diagrams; Case-studies; Consistency management; GraphicaL model; ITS applications; Language model; Model-driven Engineering; Rule-based method; System analysis and design; Use cases diagrams,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Lake K.; Flores G.,Bringing Legacy Technical Data out of the Shadows Using Modern Digital Enginering Tools,2024,AUTOTESTCON (Proceedings),0,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Digital Engineering (DE) are poised to significantly transform the automated test sector. However, the broad integration of these principles is hindered by issues related to the completeness and uniformity of existing technical data. Organizations responsible for automated test systems are often dependent of a diverse array of test requirement documents, ranging from military to contractor standards, with some legacy documents not adhering to any recognized standard or being entirely unavailable. There is a pressing need for mechanisms that can facilitate the transition from these varied legacy formats to contemporary digital engineering tools. This paper proposes a comprehensive strategy and a tooling framework designed to convert a wide range of legacy documents into a unified XML-based model format. It outlines various use cases and tooling frameworks, along with their foundational methodologies. Additionally, the paper examines the effects on the standard timelines for Test Program Set Development and proposes a structure for future innovations that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to address some of the sector's most challenging issues. Leveraging artificial intelligence is a key enabler for many of the ""legacy document to XML""translation tools presented. Modern Large Language Models (LLM) can recognize patterns in test requirements and discern meaning from the placement of data within a table or flow chart. This is powerful because it can drastically improve the quality and speed at which legacy documents are converted from PDF format to the model-based eXtensible Markup Language (XML) formats like IEEE ATML 1671. When test requirements are clearly defined upfront and not hidden from the engineering organization in legacy documents engineering managers, customers and developers can all better support the end users with accurate and faster Test Program Set development. With models in hand test asset managers will have the luxury of managing obsolescence in automated test equipment by replacing system components with instruments that meet the original Unit Under Test (UUT) requirements rather than continuously replacing instruments with comparable or better instruments in every category to ensure backwards compatibility. This often drives the cost of automated test equipment up drastically compared to the actual need and is particularly an issue when automated test equipment has been refreshed several times and supports hundreds or thousands of legacy tests.  ? 2024 IEEE.",Automatic testing; Computer testing; Cost engineering; Decision making; HTML; Instrument testing; Model checking; Problem oriented languages; Product development; Requirements engineering; Software design; Software testing; XML; Generative AI; Legacy documents; Model-based system engineerings; Model-based test; Model-based test engineering; Requirement; Test engineering; Test requirements; Test station; Test station management; Obsolescence,"K.

To explore this, we tasked a group of systems engineers to each create a list of requirements and use case diagram to satisfy a systems of systems user scenario presented in a proposal document. Participants created models of a healthcare setting in which clinicians resolved discrepancies with patient care by consulting additional sources of record, demonstrating the importance of integrating new systems within the larger healthcare system of systems. The first group were provided open access to an LLM, the second group were provided draft materials generated by an LLM, and the third followed their normal workflow. A subject matter expert (SME) evaluator then scored each model according to its completeness, consistency, correctness, simplicity, and traceability. Through this, we show that although LLMs are not a replacement for a trained systems engineer, they can contribute in two primary ways to the modeling process: first, they can generate a significant portion of the information necessary to create a minimum viable product (MVP) model within a fraction of the time, offering a promising way to accelerate the overall model development process. Second, they can answer detailed, domain-specific questions and reduce the time spent on external research. ? 2024 IEEE.",System of systems; Artificial intelligence tools; Generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Large language model; Model use; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling; System engineers; System-of-systems; Traditional systems; Artificial intelligence,"E.S.

This paper explores the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) in automating the model creation process within a novel declarative framework. Here, users engage with the system by expressing information or instructions in natural language, presenting a paradigm shift in how models can be created.

Unfortunately, these four systems are often studied individually, and rarely together as integrated systems. Instead, holistic multi-energy system models can serve to improve the understanding of these interdependent systems and guide policies that shape the systems as they evolve into the future. The NSF project entitled ※American Multi-Modal Energy System Synthetic & Simulated Data (AMES-3D)§ seeks to fill this void with an open-source, physically-informed, structural, and behavioral machine-learning model of the AMES. To that end, this paper uses a GIS-data-driven, model-based system engineering approach to develop structural models of the American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES). This paper produces and reports the hetero-functional incidence tensor, hetero-functional adjacency matrix, and the formal graph adjacency matrix in terms of their statistics. This work compares these four hetero-functional graph models across the states of New York (NY), California (CA), Texas (TX), and the United States of America (USA) as a whole.

All these data elements precisely record asset and system performance and health throughout the lifecycle of those assets and systems. However, several challenges are roadblocks in this process. While some of these challenges are technical in nature (i.e., data are often distributed over several physical servers or databases), others are conceptual in nature (i.e., data elements come in different formats, numeric or textual), and measured values have different scales (e.g., vibration spectra and oil temperature). This paper directly focuses on integrating numeric and textual data elements to assist plant system engineers in analyzing equipment reliability data. This task begins with preprocessing the data by extracting knowledge from textual data via natural language processing methods and quantifying system, asset, and component health based on numeric data. We then employ model-based system engineering (MBSE) models of systems and assets to identify their architecture and functional (i.e., cause and effect) relations. Data elements are then associated with a single MBSE graph element, based on their nature. This bonding of MBSE models and data elements constitutes a first-of-its-kind knowledge graph of a nuclear power plant system, with data elements being structured to enable system engineers to identify cause-effect trends in data elements and carry out appropriate actions in response. ?

Timperley L.; Berthoud L.; Snider C.; Tryfonas T.,Mapping the MBSE Environment and Complementary Design Space Exploration Techniques,2024,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,0,"Today's MBSE tools and environments are highly varied and therefore present a challenge for organizations looking to implement MBSE. Furthermore, while MBSE environments are highly capable of supporting the description of design baselines, the current capabilities within these environments could be further refined for exploring alternative designs. As a result it is important to gain an understanding of the limitations of current MBSE tooling in performing the valuable activity of design space exploration, and identify a set of candidate techniques to combat these. This paper reviews the various options available to MBSE practitioners by comparing some of the most common MBSE languages, tools and methods. The possible issues that can be encountered when exploring different designs have been identified and assigned a severity rating. A set of design space exploration techniques are presented, and where possible these have been sourced from existing literature. A knowledge graph has been constructed to collect all this data into a structured format, containing all the MBSE languages, tools, methods, design space exploration-related issues and techniques, as well as the relationships between each of these. This knowledge graph, implemented as a Neo4j graph database, allowed deeper insights to be drawn from the collected information. By defining a selected MBSE environment, including language, tool and method, the knowledge graph could be used to identify the least troublesome sequence (with minimum number of related issues) to arrive at a desired design artifact, for example a set of optimized system parameters. Beside this, the knowledge graph could be used to display the relationships and clusters of MBSE languages, tools and methods, to assist organizations with selecting suitable MBSE environment elements. Future work will bring greater depth to the analysis available with the knowledge graph, for instance, differentiation between different types of design space exploration issues and techniques. ? 2024 IEEE.",Design; 'current; Alternative designs; Complementary designs; Current capability; Design space exploration; Environment design; Exploration techniques; Knowledge graphs; Language tools; Tools and methods; Knowledge graph,"L.

Tong X.; Bao J.; Tao F.,Co-evolutionary digital twins: A multidimensional dynamic approach to digital engineering,2024,Advanced Engineering Informatics,1,"Digital Engineering (DE) must be able to maximize efficiency and update dynamically in order to keep up with the wave of global interconnection. The evolution of the Digital Twin (DT) plays a significant role in DE as it enables autonomous optimization and an iterative cycle. However, the intricacy of real-world settings renders conventional evolutionary investigations of a solitary DT inadequate in tackling intricate systems at a comprehensive lifecycle magnitude. To address this, this paper presents the Co-evolutionary DTs (CoEDT), which has several key characteristics. (1) CoEDT study the evolutionary behavior of interconnected multi-DT. (2) CoEDT use a co-evolutionary distributed system architecture and is a DT technology that integrate MBSE. (3) CoEDT offers detailed dynamic models for the complex interactions and co-evolution among multi-DT throughout the lifecycle. It also supports real time measurement of multi-DT behavior to detect system anomalies. The significance of CoEDT lies in providing a more comprehensive insight for future product development by constructing a parallel world that simulates the lifecycle. In the CoEDT, we tackle the behavioral identification and structure of these evolving multi-DT throughout product lifecycle through the following approaches. Initially, drawing inspiration from biological cytology, we have conceived a concept of Collective DTs (CollDTs) to observing a collective behavioral of multi-DT. Subsequently, we further developed CoEDT to depict co-evolutionary behavior patterns and established a co-evolution architecture for all DT throughout the lifecycle by fusing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Then, dynamic expressions and algorithm that can measure the co-evolution of every DT are inferred using information theory. Finally, the viability of the proposed CoEDT framework is demonstrated through the development of a solid rocket engine, which promotes the application of DT in the DE. ? 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Cytology; Information theory; Iterative methods; Memory architecture; Rockets; Co-evolution; Co-evolutionary; Digital engineering; Dynamic approaches; Iterative cycles; Lifecycle; Model-based system engineerings; Multi-dimensional dynamics; Optimisations; Real world setting; Life cycle,"J.

For example, the precast concrete parts must be able to absorb certain forces or have precise connections and joining options. The Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF) can be used to describe requirements digitally and exchange them between different IT systems and stakeholders. The creation of automated quality control (QC) protocol for the flow production process can be implemented based on this already structured and formalized requirements format. In this paper, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) from the context of Industry 4.0 is enhanced to enable the formal description and automated verification of requirements for precast concrete based on the ReqIF interchange format. For this purpose, a smart service integrates the ReqIF-compliant requirements into an AAS submodel. Via this smart service, a mapping assistance tool lets stakeholders assign measurable properties of the precast concrete modules to the requirements, thus enabling an automated quality check.

Designing and implementing an MBSE based approach for a complex system architecture enables for system safety analysis to be performed at the lowest levels of design. This is due to the dynamic nature of Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Methods (OOSEM) [a paradigm for developing and implementing system architecture in MBSE] as well as unique features [dependent on how the MBSE model is architected] that allow for system safety assessments. The resulting data outputs from an SNS MBSE model are leveraged for system safety artifacts and documentation in support of nuclear system safety certification. ? 2024 AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY.

Ahlbrecht A.; Sprockhoff J.; Durak U.,A system-theoretic assurance framework for safety-driven systems engineering,2024,Software and Systems Modeling,0,"The complexity of safety-critical systems is continuously increasing. To create safe systems despite the complexity, the system development requires a strong integration of system design and safety activities. A promising choice for integrating system design and safety activities are model-based approaches. They can help to handle complexity through abstraction, automation, and reuse and are applied to design, analyze, and assure systems. In practice, however, there is often a disconnect between the model-based design and safety activities. At the same time, there is often a delay until recent approaches are available in model-based frameworks. As a result, the advantages of the models are often not fully utilized. Therefore, this article proposes a framework that integrates recent approaches for system design (model-based systems engineering), safety analysis (system-theoretic process analysis), and safety assurance (goal structuring notation). The framework is implemented in the systems modeling language (SysML), and the focus is placed on the connection between the safety analysis and safety assurance activities. It is shown how the model-based integration enables tool assistance for the systematic creation, analysis, and maintenance of safety artifacts. The framework is demonstrated with the system design, safety analysis, and safety assurance of a collision avoidance system for aircraft. The model-based nature of the design and safety activities is utilized to support the systematic generation, analysis, and maintenance of safety artifacts. ?

Our proposed method is based on the MetroPT dataset and brings numerous advantages to metro and rail operators. By proactively predicting maintenance requirements, management can address potential system failures before they become serious issues.

Bashir S.,Towards AI-centric Requirements Engineering for Industrial Systems,2024,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,0,"Engineering large-scale industrial systems mandate an effective Requirements Engineering (RE) process. Such systems necessitate RE process optimization to align with standards, infrastructure specifications, and customer expectations. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions have been proposed, aiming to enhance the efficiency of requirements management within the RE process. Despite their advanced capabilities, generic AI solutions exhibit limited adaptability within real-world contexts, mainly because of the complexity and specificity inherent to industrial domains. This limitation notably leads to the continued prevalence of manual practices that not only cause the RE process to be heavily dependent on practitioners' experience, making it prone to errors, but also often contributes to project delays and inefficient resource utilization. To address these challenges, this Ph.D. dissertation focuses on two primary directions: i) conduct a comprehensive focus group study with a large-scale industry to determine the requirements evolution process and their inherent challenges and ii) propose AI solutions tailored for industrial case studies to automate and streamline their RE process and optimize the development of largescale systems. We anticipate that our research will significantly contribute to the RE domain by providing empirically validated insights in the industrial context. ? 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

It is a highly complex process involving multidisciplinary stakeholders, various digital tools and protocols. To address the digital discontinuity challenge during this process, this paper proposes a tradespace framework based on semantic technology and model-based systems engineering. It aims at functionality integration of requirement management, architecture definition, manufacturing system design, solution verification and visualization. An application ontology is developed to integrate assembly system domain knowledge, industrial requirements and system architecture model information.

For improved requirement management, it is recommended to identify and allocate project requirements at an early stage prior to construction for appropriate project progress monitoring and control with little effort and cost. Current requirement allocation practices rely heavily on time-consuming and error-prone manual processes due to a sheer volume of free-formatted project documents and the necessity of practitioners' judgment based on their experience and expertise. This paper aims to propose a systematic approach to assigning and clarifying project requirements to appropriate project parties. The proposed approach employs natural language processing (NLP) technique to automatically assign project requirements to responsible project parties. The allocated requirements are then incorporated into project geographical information system to present associated project requirements along with geo-spatial information. By integrating the information system with classified project requirements through NLP techniques, pro-active requirement allocation will further facilitate both managing of a variety of requirements and the real-time dissemination of them to all project parties. ? 2024 ASCE.",Information use; Natural language processing systems; Project management; Information systems integration; Language processing; Language processing techniques; Management IS; Natural languages; Planning and execution; Project execution; Project informations; Project planning; Requirement management; Information systems,"J.

For these factories, the total cost of production can increase considerably as the energy cost increases. Such an increase adds to the final cost of the products reaching the consumers. As a result, energy efficiency has been considered an important decision-making aspect besides productivity, quality, cost, and flexibility in manufacturing. However, making good decisions to improve energy efficiency in manufacturing is a complex and difficult undertaking. These decisions require tradeoffs among many factors affecting these processes to reach good outcomes. This makes realizing different methods that utilize innovative technologies and help in decision making related to energy efficiency in manufacturing tremendously important. Unfortunately, there are only limited methods and tools developed for decision making support for energy efficiency of manufacturing processes.

Traditional document-based systems engineering approaches face numerous challenges in terms of communication efficiency, traceability, and maintenance when dealing with complex product system design. Consequently, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been widely adopted. To improve the efficiency of system modelling, an effective method is needed to automate the process by reusing existing design resources. This study proposes a knowledge graph-based approach for the automatic generation of system model diagrams, consisting of three main steps. Firstly, a system model graph is constructed using an existing system model repository. Then, the required modelling elements are extracted from design documents, and reusable model elements are obtained based on the system model graph. Lastly, a mapping relationship is established between system model elements extracted from multi-source heterogeneous data and SysML metamodel, enabling the automatic generation of system model diagrams based on SysML views. This approach effectively leverages the information from the existing system model repository and achieves automated mapping conversion from multi-source heterogeneous data to the SysML system model.

Yao Z.; Wu H.; Song Y.; Cheng Y.; Pan H.; Wu M.; Li M.; Qin G.; Wang Q.; Zhang X.,Surrogate model-based cognitive digital twin for smart remote maintenance of fusion reactor: modeling and implementation,2024,Nuclear Fusion,0,"A remote maintenance robot system (RMRS) plays a critical role in safeguarding the fusion energy experimental device＊s security and stability. State-of-the-art intelligent technology such as cognitive digital twins (CDTs) is widely considered capable of improving complex equipment＊s performance and reducing management burden using a visualized system. However, the CDT virtual space cannot mirror the RMRS which is a kind of flexible multi-body system in real-time and with high fidelity. Therefore, we propose a CDT modeling method based on a surrogate model for the RMRS. Firstly, model-based system engineering is leveraged to build a structural modular architecture, which can decrease the modeling complexity of CDT and increase the modeling efficiency. Then, the surrogate models are self-learning within the CDT physical space, which reconstructs the RMRS＊s real-time dynamic performances and endows CDT with cognitive capabilities. Finally, after integrating the CDT system, a smart decision-making plan that compensates for the operation error is generated for RMRS＊s accurate control. We take a China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) multi-purpose overload robot (CMOR) as an example to demonstrate the implementation process. According to the results, CDT can achieve real-time (230 ms time delay) high-fidelity (5 mm control error) monitoring and accurate control, and CMOR conducts smart maintenance based on the simulation results.

These requirements have led to the development of autonomous technologies and systems to enable more Earth independence, while at the same time relying more heavily on the knowledge contained in their computational models (as opposed to the knowledge of ground control experts). For environmental control and life support systems, these consist of disparate models often tailored to specific subsystems and use cases, such as temperature control and CO2 removal. Therefore, there is a need for technologies supporting the integration of existing models. We propose to extend existing digital twin frameworks to integrate models and serve as a tool for answering onboard queries during operation. Toward this vision, we identify research directions for three types of technologies: i) streamlining the process of merging information models without redundancies by leveraging model-based systems engineering languages; ii) the calibration of simulation models that requires a better understanding of how to encode domain knowledge into a probabilistic representation of subsystem states and model parameters; and iii) automating the query understanding process and constructing a mapping between information and simulation models. ? 2023 by Nicolas Gratius, Min Young Hwang, Zhichen Wang, Mario Berg谷s, Burcu Akinci, Yu Hou, Annika Rollock, and Cory George.",Digital control systems; Digital elevation model; Direct air capture; Knowledge representation; Tropics; Autonomous technology; Computational modelling; Control experts; Environmental control and life support system; Ground control; Human spaceflights; Information Modeling; Self awareness; Simulation model; Technologies and systems; Environmental management,"N.

Consequently, achieving interoperability among various components and different digital twin systems is crucial. In the current landscape, characterized by various languages supporting diverse semantic models, achieving interoperability is a complex task. Achieving interoperability might involve translating diverse models, either peer-to-peer or through a central pivotal model. In this study, we propose a model-driven engineering approach that leverages higher-order transformations in conjunction with the Asset Administration Shell, acting as the pivotal model to tackle the interoperability challenges associated with digital twin systems. Higher-order transformations are a specific type of model transformation, characterized by their input and/or output being model transformations themselves. Our hypothesis is that such transformations would eliminate the need to manually craft multiple translations toward the Asset Administration Shell. In-stead, a single higher-order transformation would automatically generate these translations. We chose the Asset Administration Shell as our pivotal model, because it is widely recognized as a foundational element for application interoperability in Industry 4.0/5.0. We illustrate our approach through a vehicle use case represented using the Systems Modeling Language version 2 and consolidating this description into an Asset Administration Shell model. Hence, we showcase the applicability and suitability of our proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first effort to address the translation of Systems Modeling Language version 2 into the Asset Administration Shell.  ? 2024 IEEE.",'current; Asset administration shell; Functionals; High-order; Higher-order; Model transformation; Model-driven Engineering; Order transformation; SysML v2; System models; Interoperability,; ; ,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,

Implementing a continuous driver authentication system based on unique driving behaviors enhances security through improved access control without the use of personally identifiable information (PII). This ensures that only authorized drivers operate the vehicle and reduces the risk of unauthorized use. Designing this complex system to reduce this risk can be done effectively through SysML modeling and MagicGrid systems modeling. Through the use of systems modeling, this study was split into two main objectives. The first objective is to develop this driver authentication system by analyzing behavior patterns through three sets of vehicle sensor data: CANbus, GPS, and IMU data. These collect extensive vehicle data like vehicle speed, engine speed, pedal positions, location, and heading degree. This data is then used to train several different machine learning models to create a driver profile report for identity verification. The second objective is to run cyberattacks on the vehicle and analyze the driver's behavior with physiological data like heart rate variability and with the vehicle sensor data. The cyberattacks cause a malfunction on the vehicle's instrument cluster by sending various messages to the CANbus. This is used to create a report on how drivers respond in high pressure conditions, which can be used to train drivers transporting hazardous material to react properly in these situations. The purpose of this paper is to show how the application of the MagicGrid method and SysML modeling improved the development of the stakeholder needs, requirements, use cases, and system structure. ? 2024 IEEE.",Access control models; Automobile drivers; Liquid level indicators; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Network security; Railroad transportation; Satellites; Steganography; Authentication systems; Automotive security; Automotives; Data collection; Driver's behavior; Heavy duty vehicles; MBSE; Sensors data; System models; Vehicle sensors; Authentication,"T.

Gregory J.; Salado A.,A Semantic Approach to Spacecraft Verification Planning Using Bayesian Networks,2024,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,4,"The design and execution of an effective spacecraft verification strategy is a critical and complex undertaking. It necessitates the generation and management of a large amount of highly connected data. As a result, verification activities consume a significant part, if not the biggest part, of the development costs of large-scale engineered systems. Current document-based approaches to verification planning and assessment are inefficient, prone to inconsistencies, and unable to quantitatively inform about the confidence level on the verification status of the system of interest. A Digital Engineering (DE) approach to verification planning and assessment can overcome these weaknesses. To achieve this, data integration and management technologies are crucial. Semantic Web Technologies (SWTs) provide a means to structure knowledge, validate knowledge, and infer new knowledge using ontologies, reasoners, and query languages. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to planning verification strategies supported by the Bayesian Verification Ontology Stack (BVOS). The BVOS is a modular ontology stack that supports a semantic approach to DE. The ontologies it comprises are constructed using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML). The BVOS leverages existing ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) to support the required domain-level ontologies such as the System Architecture Ontology and the Bayesian Network Ontology. To evaluate this approach, it has been applied to the Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) of a notional spacecraft and its verification strategy. The ADCS requirements are captured in Jama Connect. The physical architecture of the ADCS and the corresponding verification strategy are modeled using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) v2. A representative OML knowledge graph that captures the entire dataset is produced and validated using the BVOS, and is used to generate a Bayesian representation of the verification strategy. ? 2024 IEEE.",Bayesian networks; Data integration; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Modeling languages; Network architecture; Query languages; Semantic Web; Attitude determination and control subsystems; Bayesia n networks; Bayesian; Digital engineering; Large amounts; Ontological modeling; Ontology's; Result verifications; Semantic approach; Verification Strategy; Ontology,"J.

Urban intersections are one of the primary sources of traffic congestion, and these bottlenecks have a negative impact not only on traffic efficacy but also on the surrounding road traffic in the region. To alleviate urban traffic congestion, cyber-physical systems have been widely implemented in the transportation industry, allowing for the perception, analysis, calculation, and dispatching of urban traffic flow, as well as making urban transportation safe, efficient, and quick. As the system scale and functions increase, system design has become increasingly complex, necessitating a deeper comprehension of the system's structure and interaction relationships to construct a stable and reliable system. Therefore, this study proposes a method for designing cyber-physical systems for urban traffic intersections based on Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). This method models and analyses exhaustively the system's requirements, functions, and logical architecture using System Modeling Language (SysML). After the architecture design has been completed, an architecture verification and optimization method based on Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) for urban road intersection cyber-physical systems is utilized to analyze the architecture's reliability by analyzing the failure modes of activities and to optimize the system architecture to improve the design's efficiency and reliability. ? 2018 Tsinghua University Press.",Artificial intelligence; Energy balance; Failure modes; Integrated circuit design; Large scale systems; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Street traffic control; Urban transportation; Architecture designs; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Model-based system engineering; Model-based system engineerings; Rapid growth; System modeling language; System models; Urban intersections; Urban traffic congestion; Traffic congestion,"X.

The pre-established production rules in a traditional centralized control manufacturing system present difficulties in accommodating dynamic situations. Although a multi-agent manufacturing system (MAMS) yields natural advantages in handling dynamic emergencies, the current research is limited to the computer simulation level and lacks integration with the underlying physical devices. In order to mitigate said challenges, the standardization modeling approach for the agent computing node (ACN) to facilitate the implementation of a readily deployable MAMS was proposed in the present study. Initially, adapters encompassing communication, decision, and control modules were developed within the industrial personnel computer-based computing node to accommodate the heterogeneous interface protocols of diverse machines. These adapters enable communication and interaction among machines while laying the computational foundation for the ACN. Accordingly, the models of the machine agent, the part agent, and the monitoring agent were constructed based on ACNs and could perceive the dynamic production information and support the enabling application. Subsequently, to guide ACNs in making scheduling decisions beneficial to global performance, an improved negotiation mechanism in MAMS was achieved in real-time. Finally, the proposed MAMS based on the ACN was deployed in an actual flexible machining workshop. Comparative experiments were implemented and, as exhibited from the experimental results, the proposed ACNs possessed the capabilities of achieving optimal global decision-making and facilitating straightforward deployment. ? 2024 by ASME.",Decision making; Dynamics; Industrial research; Internet of things; Personnel; Application contexts; Case-studies; Computing nodes; Customization services; Engineering informatics; Industrial internet of thing; Manufacturing Automation; Model-based system engineerings; Multi-agent manufacturing system; Node architectures; Multi agent systems,"Z.

The transition from traditional document-based models to digital models requires training in modeling languages and modeling methods to apply model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tools and techniques. These pillars are essential to designing digital models and employing a systems-thinking framework. Digital engineering skills focusing on MBSE topics are currently not widely available in undergraduate or graduate programs. We propose a modular approach for integrating these topics in a set of core courses in the second and third years of the engineering curriculum, building incremental skills across this two-year period, and leading to their application in capstone design projects in the final year. The modules are drawn from a recently implemented Digital Engineering graduate certificate for training a civilian Air Force cohort. This twelve-credit certificate included four semester-long courses in: (i) Systems, Models and Simulation for Digital Engineering; (ii) Model-Based Systems Engineering; (iii) Cyber-Physical Systems and Simulation; and (iv) Data-Driven Decision-Making and Risk Management. The modules are hosted on an online learning and course management system. Each module includes an experiential learning project that supports designing use cases with relevant stakeholders, conducting interviews with non-engineering domain-experts and end users of the system or creating digital models using systems modeling languages such as the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). We pay particular attention to ensuring engineers learn to incorporate a human-centric approach in systems modeling, fostering a holistic and user-centric design process. This paper presents one example of a case study that introduces students to concepts of stakeholders, use cases and requirements analysis. The example takes the student through a sequence of stages using tools provided by UAF and SysML.

While CD methods are commonly applied in space systems conceptual design, their focus has primarily centered on space segments and payloads. Ground segment and utilization aspects were typically considered only at a higher level, and favoring conventional approaches and designs. The pressing need for CD within Ground Segment and Operations (GS&OPS) arises from the distinctive requirements of space ventures. The ever-increasing complexity and interconnection of ground segment components, including the expansion of constellations and formations, demand an adaptable framework to effectively manage these intricacies. Moreover, the rise in automation, autonomy, and the integration of non-space entities into distributed operational strategies underscores the necessity for a tailored CD approach within GS&OPS. Additionally, the emergence of advanced information technology, characterized by AI techniques and web- and cloud-based system configurations, intensifies the call for a CD process that seamlessly aligns with Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodologies in this domain. At the Technical University of Darmstadt, a joint ESA-TU Darmstadt Concurrent Engineering Lab (CEL) has been established, providing the environment for research on CD in GS&OPS conceptual design.

The INCOSE Vision 2035 sets goals for systems engineering (SE) as a discipline in enabling engineering solutions for a better world: ?By 2035, cybersecurity will be as foundational a perspective in systems design as system performance and safety are today? (INCOSE, 2024). A key objective of the INCOSE Future of Systems Engineering (FuSE) Security Foundations Roadmap is to recognize system security as a fundamental part of the mission, integrated into the system architecture, and not ?bolted-on? as a separate subsystem or set of features in the detailed design. To achieve this, systems engineering must address system security early in the system lifecycle, during the mission analysis and concept development phase and ensure it is addressed as a functional requirement throughout the systems engineering lifecycle. System security needs must be treated as fundamental system capability. The INCOSE FuSE Security foundations roadmap identifies six (6) objectives and eleven (11) foundational concepts necessary to achieve the FuSE vision for system security (Dove, et al., 2021). Five of the objectives and five of the foundational concepts are directly related to systems acquisition and engineering lifecycle processes. The five key foundational concepts are: Stakeholder Alignment, Security as a Capability, Security as a Functional Requirement, Loss Driven Engineering and Modeled Trustworthiness. The Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) community has extensive cyber assessment and execution processes mandated through numerous Department of Defense (DoD) and individual service policies, directives and guidebooks. This paper studies several of the cybersecurity assessment and process guidebooks, analyzing the processes and methods to identify areas where systems engineering should be responsible, and which SE activities and outputs are needed to enable the requirements of each guidebook. This paper examines six OT&E cyber security guidebooks, and the methods and processes they describe to achieve system security in relation to the five foundation concepts. In addition to their test and evaluation processes, each describes systems engineering processes, activities and outputs that could be used to form the initial foundation of a system security technical process. While the original INCOSE vision statement uses the term ?cybersecurity,? the FuSE Security initiative is adopting the term ?system security? to emphasize that this is a system engineering responsibility as opposed to software engineering or information technology task. As a result, the analysis of the cybersecurity guidebooks will be in the context of ?system security.?",Cybersecurity; FuSE Security; Cyber Survivability; Mission Based Cybersecurity Risk Analysis (MBCRA); Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE),\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

In this work, we investigate the effects of this approach during the design phase. We argue that, by eliminating potentially conflicting direct interfaces between IT and OT stakeholders within the organizational structure, this approach effectively eliminates conflicting communication channels within the system design. To verify our argument, we develop a model of our IBPT concept according to the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0) using an Industry 4.0 scenario addressing the four essential Industry 4.0 design principles.

First, no known standardized interfaces between the MBSE model and game engine visualization are defined, which can lead to custom or stove-piped solutions. Additionally, visualizing digital twin models in true to life scale is insufficient with typical desktop computers. The Bi-Directional Interface Requirements Operational System Test (BIFROST) prototype, funded by the US Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation, seeks to address these challenges. Progress of the BIFROST prototype is covered in the paper. The prototype aims to determine the feasibility and challenges of validating interfaces through visualizing changes to an MBSE model in a 3D game engine. Research was performed to visualize part of an uncrewed aircraft system ground control station in 3D using the Unity game engine. A Mission Control Architecture MBSE model, developed by PEO Aviation, is used to drive the digital twin of the ground control station through a set of virtual reality (VR) controls. Users can visualize, analyze, and test the human-machine interaction of the 3D models in VR prior to real-world system changes. This paper presents the recommended interfaces between the MBSE model and 3D engine, lessons learned, and future research areas.",MBSE; Digital; Engineering; Interface Validation,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,

This paper underscores the indispensable role of ModelBased Systems Engineering (MBSE) in addressing the multiphase issues inherent in our product complexity. The first focal point is the certification process, where Safran SEATS navigates the complexities imposed by aerospace manufacturers and stringent airworthiness regulations. This intricate certification process demands the strategic deployment of MBSE to streamline and enhance procedural efficiency. The second challenge arises from the abstract nature of style and perceived quality requirements articulated by diverse customers. With the goal of exceeding customer expectations and creating a genuine ?WOW? effect, MBSE becomes instrumental in aligning product development with diverse and often oriented customers' needs. The third dimension of complexity stems from the variability in emerging requirements, where innovations swiftly become industry standards. MBSE provides a structured approach to handle this variability, ensuring adaptability and positioning products at the forefront of innovation. Additionally, we dissect the influence of Model-Based Design (MBD) on design processes, shedding light on its transformative effects. Introducing the concept of a digital twin, we explore its significance in the aerospace domain. Real-world implementations of digital twin technology examined through concrete examples from aerospace projects. Finally, the presentation addresses uncertainties surrounding program efficiency, a critical consideration in the intensely competitive seat market.

"Papke B., Wang G., Densford S., Valerdi R.",The Convergence of COSYSMO Parametric Cost Estimation with Model-Based Systems Engineering,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The promise of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and its advertised benefits hinge on the ability of our profession to integrate engineering disciplines and project management across the system life cycle. In particular, connecting system architecture and design decisions to the economics of the system's development is a critically important topic, but has often been overlooked by the system engineering community. Achieving such integration requires two key elements: (1) the standardization of multidisciplinary terms and functions, and (2) the establishment of rules governing relationships between cross-functional models and modeling environments. This paper contributes to these areas by (1) establishing common terminology describing systems engineering and cost estimating, and (2) proposing specific cost drivers and counting rules within an MBSE environment that can be applied to estimating systems engineering effort using the COSYSMO cost model. COSYSMO is a systems engineering cost model, originally developed in 2005, and was grounded on document-based systems engineering methods. This paper facilitates the convergence of COSYSMO and MBSE by updating the COSYSMO counting rules to specifically address size driver selection and assessment in a SysML model. It illustrates how advanced modeling tool features streamline and automate cost estimation activities, while queries and crosscutting views offered by modern MBSE tools enhance the completeness, quality, and consistency of parametric cost estimation process. Additionally, it provides guidelines for identifying system model content and level of detail for cost estimating, and proposes an approach to link attributes and properties in a system model to the variables in the COSYSMO cost estimating relationship.",COSYSMO; Parametric Cost Estimating; MBSE; Reuse,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

In a typical engineering curriculum, however, courses are still treated as ?siloes?, and students often do not have the opportunity to experience this industrially relevant approach to engineering. The Digital Engineering Factory (DEF) is a digital engineering environment under development at the University of Arizona to support engineering students. The DEF supports students by providing access to multiple engineering tools and is structured using a ?hub-and-spoke? approach to consolidate data from these tools. Through this connected architecture, students can transfer data generated in a particular course to tools for use in other courses. Connecting course activities in this way enables students to experience a complete end-to-end system lifecycle. At its ?hub?, the DEF uses Violet to integrate data from multiple sources, create a digital thread, and generate a graph representation of the dataset. This knowledge graph, written in the Ontological Modeling Language (OML), can be viewed in OML Rosetta and is structured according to the University of Arizona Ontology Stack (UAOS). The use of the UAOS and OML Rosetta allows instructors to leverage semantic web technologies to support teaching activities such as grading.

"Torkjazi M., Raz A.",Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Methodology for Integrating Autonomy into a System of Systems Using the Unified Architecture Framework,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\," Stakeholders of Systems of Systems (SoSs) are seeking new capabilities provided by autonomous systems empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This requires the integration of these autonomous systems into SoSs, resulting in Systems of Autonomous Systems (SoASs). SoAS architecting is different from SoS. An autonomous system can have various Levels of Autonomy (LoA) depending on its AI algorithm. Each LoA has a different impact on the organizational and technical aspects of SoAS architecting. The organizational aspect covers concerns such as managerial and operational policies, whereas the technical aspect highlights issues such as integration compatibility between systems. Failure to address the LoA impact on these aspects in the architecting phase results in an ineffective integration. In this paper, we propose a methodology that follows the SoS hierarchical lexicon, builds upon the steps of the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM), and leverages the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) for modeling autonomy integration. The proposed methodology adds detailed sub-steps to OOSEM in order to make it suitable for SoS evolution into SoAS. We also introduce the required UAF views for modeling each aspect of the SoAS architecture. This methodology lays the foundation for the trade study analysis that helps stakeholders decide on suitable LoAs for SoAS. We also present an illustrative example to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",Autonomy integration; Level of autonomy; SoS architecture; MBSE methodology; UAF,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

This transformation promotes consistency and allows for tracing system model elements to the corresponding norm model elements. Despite these efforts, the current digitization activities heavily rely on manual extraction and transformation, particularly from PDF documents into SysML models. Concurrently, the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in recent years presents an opportunity to automate such activities. This paper contributes to the integration of AI with MBSE, focusing solely on the extraction and transformation of medical standards information from documents into SysML norm models.

"Xames M., Topcu T.",A Rapid Review of How Model-based Systems Engineering is Used in Healthcare Systems,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"This study presents the results from rapid review of how model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is utilized in healthcare systems (HSs). We conduct a review of the last twelve years and find that MBSE adoption in HSs is accelerating, with use of various MBSE languages and tools, as well as their integration with other simulation and modeling techniques. We find that similar to engineered systems, the most common MBSE language is systems modeling language (SysML), followed by unified modeling language (UML) and others. Additionally, we observe that MBSE methods are frequently used in conjunction with other analytical techniques, such as simulation and co-simulations, to analyze and enhance various HS operations, or to assist with making tradeoffs between HS attributes such as quality and cost. Moreover, we provide a non-exhaustive classification of current research based on two dimensions: healthcare applications and MBSE use cases. Notably, MBSE is being implemented generally with patient-centric objectives in various HS domains, including IoT-enabled smart healthcare, clinical medicine, medical device development, healthcare process enhancement, and healthcare facilities management. While the primary MBSE use case involves modeling different aspects of healthcare operations, there is a significant number of studies that pursue requirements engineering, systems analysis, integration, verification and validation, as well as risk analysis and management. Furthermore, we identify two promising research gaps. First, there is a need for the integration of MBSE with state-of-the-art data-driven analytical methodologies such as hybrid simulation and artificial intelligence techniques. Second, HSs could greatly benefit from representing the cognitive functions and processes of human decision-makers in the loop, such as healthcare providers (e.g., doctors and nurses), who are instrumental in sustaining the HS performance and functionality. We contend that MBSE and other SE methods and techniques could improve HSs design, operations, and management; while fostering resilience and long-term sustainability.",Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); healthcare systems; sociotechnical systems; human-in-the-loop systems,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,
"H?llqvist R., Herzog E., Axehill J., Palmer J.","Excuse me Sir/Madam, which Model?",2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Development of complex systems through the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) will require the creation and maintenance of multiple models, created using multiple languages. Hence, structuring the models such that there is efficient support for incremental development requires some foresight. Having models with multiple or unclear purposes may introduce situations where parts of the organisation will ask for modification for representing a desired future system state, whereas other parts of the organisation require it to remain unchanged in order to represent the present state. This paper introduces a structure with associated terms and characteristics of the different model types in order to provide guidance to an organisation. In particular, it extends previous work on model tenses, capturing different time perspectives/purposes on the models, to also include model usage for keeping track of the actual state of a realised system instance. For example, the concepts of Digital Twin and Digital Shadow are discussed and conceptualised. As such, the contributions made in the paper allows an organisation to reason about the completeness of their modelling methodology and its applicability to support incremental development.

DeHart J.,Leveraging Large Language Models for Direct Interaction with SysML v2,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"This paper examines the potential integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Systems Modeling Language version 2 (SysML v2), proposing a novel methodology for systems engineering by capitalizing on the enhanced readability and human-friendly syntax of SysML v2. Given the emergent sophistication of LLMs and the coincidental development of SysML v2?-an endeavor that presents a pivot toward naturally articulated model interaction?-we explore the possibilities and implications of such an intersection. Our investigation posits that LLMs can serve not only as an interpretive layer, allowing for the syntactically simplified manipulation of system models, but also as a catalyst for a knowledge-driven design approach. We highlight the efficiencies gained by deploying LLMs for SysML v2 interactions, which reduce the dependency on technical expertise traditionally needed for API navigation and model management. Through case studies and analysis, we demonstrate that the conversational engagement with system models facilitated by LLMs can lead to a democratized and accelerated design process. However, this advent is tempered by a critical awareness of potential pitfalls, such as automation bias and overreliance on automated systems?-underscoring the need for continued human oversight and the examination of ethical considerations. Emphasizing the chance of SysML v2 being inherently English-based and the parallel maturation of LLMs, this paper suggests that the collaborative utilization of these concurrent advancements may offer an opportune fusion, potentially revolutionizing the way systems are modeled and managed. Future work involves the empirical validation of these approaches and a deeper investigation into interoperability with existing and future systems engineering ecosystems. The ultimate goal is to ensure that this fusion not only complements human expertise but also propels systems engineering into a new era of innovation and holistic design.",API; AI; Assistant; Large Language Model; LLM; MBSE; SysMLv2,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,
"Vereno D., Polanec K., Gross J., Binder C., Neureiter C.",Introducing a Three-Layer Model Taxonomy to Facilitate System-of-Systems Co-Simulation,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The growing demand for efficient, resilient, and sustainable electricity infrastructure has led to the emergence of smart grids as cyber-physical systems of systems. Co-simulation has proven an effective tool for their analysis and validation by coordinating independent subsystem simulations. However, the reuse and integration of diverse models in co-simulation poses challenges, requiring compatibility and integration efforts. In response, this paper proposes a model taxonomy with the purpose of facilitating co-simulation; it comprises three layers: concrete-instance models, abstract-instance models, and type models. The taxonomy contributes to the creation of independently developed models that can be seamlessly integrated into a coupled co-simulation. Furthermore, it reflects the emergence of digital twins in smart grid engineering by the explicit distinction of abstract and concrete instances. The three-layer taxonomy was derived and validated through a case study on co-simulation of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure. The research further analyzes and formalizes three modeling-and-simulation challenges framed through the lens of the taxonomy: the integration of models across all three layers, the merging of layers, and the consolidation of instance models to craft joint co-simulation scenarios. Finally, three concrete recommendations for research and industrial practice are given. Thereby, the study contributes to the efficient and effective model-based validation of cyber-physical systems of systems using co-simulation.",model-based systems engineering; power systems; cyber-physical systems; digital twin; modeling and simulation,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,
"D'Souza A., Hetherington D., Kulcs芍r G., Orozco B., Przyby?o A., R芍th I.",Configuration Management of Sets of Links in a Federated Tool Environment,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"In the era of document-centric systems engineering, large organizations developing complex systems had practical methods of associating drawings, specifications, requirements and other information with each other. Mostly these evolved methods involved part numbers and drawing numbers, although sometimes the methods included mundane techniques such as storing drawings in specific drawers in specific filing cabinets. These manual methods were very labor intensive, did not handle changes gracefully, and were somewhat error prone. As computer software and modeling tools began to displace paper drawings and filing cabinets, a ?connect and forget? style of linking evolved. We can see this sort of thinking in the relationships in UML and SysML, but also in other places such as the use of Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) in the XMI file format underlying UML/SysML, the relationships in DOORS and related requirements tools, as well as the original architecture of OSLC which depended on URIs embedded in design artifacts to establish relationships. While these ?click to connect? features provided increased convenience compared to the previous manual numbering approaches, these ?hard-coded? links have introduced a new set of problems. The root of most of the new problems comes in the difficulty of managing this sort of extremely large set of direct links as configuration items in their own right. In a larger system, this sort of link set quickly grows to thousands or even millions of links. Managing change, modularity, variants, subsystem reuse, and so on all become very difficult in the presence of such a large, unplanned, and uncontrolled link set. In this paper, we will review the different approaches to creating and managing such sets of links and provide a concise best practices recommendation for the configuration management of such sets of links.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,
"Yeiser A., Pavalkis S., Yakimenko O.",Exploring the Executable SysML Capabilities to Integrate and Operate Hardware in the Loop,2024,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"These days, systems engineers use advanced software tools and standardized modeling methods to break down complex systems into simpler, less complicated parts that are easier to understand. This includes CATIA Magic that allows for systems architecture, as well as more in-depth Systems Modeling Language (SysML) modeling and simulation. The goal of this paper is to explore the capabilities of SysML to model and control hardware in the loop (HIL). The model of a weapon system was created using several different diagrams commonly used in SysML. When these diagrams are used together with the CATIA Magic simulation toolkit (Magic Model Analyzer), they can be made executable and used for simulation purposes. While CATIA Magic was selected to provide a digital model of the weapon system, a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 development kit was selected to create a mockup of a physical system. The CATIA Magic model reacts to the inputs received from the LEGO sensors and sends control signals to motors built into the LEGO model. In general, the integration between the LEGO Mindstorms and CATIA Magic can be done successfully, however, this study revealed certain limitations pertinent to the current capability of CATIA Magic to make connections between the SysML model and LEGO hardware. While these limitations did not allow for a full integration and in-depth testing of the created dynamic model, as intended, the paper presents the current state of the project discussing what is involved in integrating CATIA Magic and LEGO Mindstorms kits and what functionality could be achieved by doing this. The paper pursues both the educational aspect that allows a deeper exploration of the modern system modeling tools, and the practical aspect, showing how a SysML model can be integrated with HIL to provide opportunities to better understand the design space at earlier stages of system development.",SysML; Digital Twin of Weapon System; Lego Mindstorms; Executable Model; Hardware in the Loop,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Manual tracing numerous artifacts produced throughout the development process is error-prone and takes much time. To address these problems, we proposed a tool (Bonner, M.; Zeller, M.; Schulz, G.; Beyer, D.; Olteanu, M., 2023), which allows to establish links between requirements and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in a semi-automatic way. The underlying algorithms of our tool are embedding similarity computation and classification approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs). To assess the performance of underlying algorithm we propose an evaluation, where we compare the recall, the precision, and the F2 score of different approaches applied to our datasets. The goal of our evaluation is to understand how well LLMs perform in automatically generating trace links on different datasets. Our evaluation shows that it is worth to invest time in preprocessing the data and fine-tuning the LLMs to achieve the better recommendations for engineers, which improves the traceability process.",LLM; Requirement Engineering; MBSE; Semantic Web; Knowledge Graph,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,
Van Bossuyt D.L.; Hale B.; Arlitt R.; Papakonstantinou N.,Zero-Trust for the System Design Lifecycle,2023,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,5,"In an age of worsening global threat landscape and accelerating uncertainty, the design and manufacture of systems must increase resilience and robustness across both the system itself and the entire systems design process. We generally trust our colleagues after initial clearance/background checks; and systems to function as intended and within operating parameters after safety engineering review, verification, validation, and/ or system qualification testing. This approach has led to increased insider threat impacts; thus, we suggest moving to the ""trust, but verify""approach embodied by the Zero-Trust paradigm. Zero-Trust is increasingly adopted for network security but has not seen wide adoption in systems design and operation. Achieving the goal of Zero-Trust throughout the systems lifecycle will help to ensure that no single bad actor-whether human or machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)-can induce failure anywhere in a system's lifecycle. Additionally, while ML/AI and their associated risks are already entrenched within the operations phase of many systems' lifecycles, ML/AI is gaining traction during the design phase. For example, generative design algorithms are increasingly popular, but there is less understanding of potential risks. Adopting the Zero-Trust philosophy helps ensure robust and resilient design, manufacture, operations, maintenance, upgrade, and disposal of systems. We outline the rewards and challenges of implementing Zero-Trust and propose the framework for Zero-Trust for the system design lifecycle.

Digital twin technology provides strong support for the achievement of cyber-physical system and intelligent manufacturing. Many investigations have been carried out for the digital twin of specific products. However, there are less researches on digital twin in the shop-floor domain, and there is a lack of model-driven digital twin comprehensive architecture. The modeling approach to the full lifecycle of digital twin is not considered enough. This paper proposes a meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin construction approach and a comprehensive architecture. A meta-model based on RAMI 4.0 is constructed, which provide a novel idea for the description of manufacturing resources and their status. The proposed shop-floor digital twin architecture consists of three key implementation elements: the meta-model construction, data modeling (including data interaction between cyber-physical spaces) and constructing different integration level models of shop-floor digital twin based on iteration feedback between the demands and models.

General trust in learning-based, complex, self-adaptive cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is low. For the technology to be accepted and trusted for more industrial and commercial use, proper V&V techniques, methods, frameworks, and theories are required to ensure desired outcomes. Principal findings show that traditional V&V methods could be classified as either inspection, demonstration, testing, or analysis. These conventional methods are highly nuanced for complex systems. They may even work for large CPSs where determinism and linear internal properties are assumed. However, the self-adaptive learning nature of AI-systems calls for adapted or new V&V methods. Primary complications encountered in V&V activities for AI-enabled systems relate to input data quality, model and requirements management, non-determinism, and AI black-box effect related to poor explainability, scale, and complexity issues. This review highlights the importance of a designated data officer with authority and capability to manage the relevant data for being relevant, available, bias-free, and adversarial sample free. Also, an issue list or complications may also provide caution for implementing AI-systems.  ? 2023 IEEE.",Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Information management; Learning systems; Artificial intelligence systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Learning-based; Model-based system engineerings; Non Determinism; SE4AI; Systematic literature review; Verification & validation method; Verification-and-validation; Verification,"W.

Gao B.,"Understanding smart education continuance intention in a delayed benefit context: An integration of sensory stimuli, UTAUT, and flow theory",2023,Acta Psychologica,18,"Smart education is a combination of AI and education, and its benefits are delayed. Existing research lacks an understanding of smart education continuance intention in the context of this delayed benefit. Thus, this study aimed to examine users' continuance intention in a delayed benefit context by integrating sensory stimulus, the extended UTAUT, and flow theory. The study focused on a mobile-based smart education (MBSE) system (Liulishuo) and collected data on 494 MBSE users. The PLS-SEM analysis suggested that the model is largely supported. Identifying MBSE's technical attributes as sensory stimuli, the extended UTAUT as primary information processing, flow as secondary information processing, and continuance intention as a decision, this study verifies the relationships between various constructs and their influence on MBSE continuance intention. The results also indicate that a user's flow state plays a crucial role in strengthening continuance intention and realizing the delayed benefits of smart education. Thus, this study provides a deeper understanding of continuous usage mechanisms as they relate to smart education. ? 2023 The Author",Cognition; Data Collection; Educational Status; Humans; Intention; behavior; cognition; educational status; human; information processing,"B.

Hassan F.U.; Le T.,Ontology-Based Approach to Risk-Factor Identification to Support the Management of Provisions in Bridge Design,2023,Journal of Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution in Engineering and Construction,1,"Requirement management is crucial in the design stage of infrastructure project delivery to ensure the designed facility satisfies the owner expectations and avoids any costly redesign, rework, and disputes. The requirements are primarily described in design codes and standards. The relevant requirements from codes are transformed into a set of in computer-readable rules required for computer-aided design and compliance verification. Prior to the construction of rules, the requirements in codes must be converted into an organized, structured format in terms of risks to support easy retrieval of the relevant applicable requirements. However, the unavailability of risk information in the requirement text makes it challenging for a designer to extract the relevant requirements of specific risks to support design tasks, including compliance checking. The manual process of requirement classification according to risk factors is time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone because the codes are mostly voluminous, including thousands of specifications. Much less attention has been paid to develop an automated framework to organize the requirements in terms of risks addressed in them. To address this need, this study has attempted to develop an ontology-based framework to identify relevant risk factors addressed in bridge design requirements to support requirement management. The nine risk factors of bridge engineering used in this study included flood, earthquake, fire, snowfall, wind, temperature, overloading, vessel collision, and blast loading. A risk ontology was developed to represent the conceptualized semantic knowledge associated with each of the nine risk factors. The algorithm was validated on a human-annotated requirement dataset based on the AASHTO bridge design specifications and state design manuals. The developed model yielded a Spearman, Kendall tau, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.7223, 0.6021, and 0.7222, respectively. The proposed model is expected to improve specifications retrieval for rules construction, thereby enabling ease of requirement classification for the design process.  ? 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Classification (of information); Compliance control; Computer aided design; Correlation methods; Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Risks; Semantics; Specifications; Text processing; Bridge design; Deep learning; Design codes; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology's; Requirement; Text classification; Text-mining; Ontology,"F.U.

Plachinda P.; Morgan J.; Coelho M.,Towards Net Zero: Modeling Approach to the Right-Sized Facilities,2023,Sustainability (Switzerland),3,"As the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere increases, the concerns about carbon emissions are growing. Several net-zero initiatives are taking place around the globe to achieve a balance between the GHGs put into the atmosphere and those taken out. While most efforts present a sectorized approach, this paper describes the importance of integrating information across different sectors for effective modeling of carbon emissions and holistic reduction opportunity analysis. Using the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) campus as a test case, this work provides a web-based tool for INL stakeholders to use when engaging in strategic planning to achieve carbon emissions reduction. This net-zero engineering support tool (NEST) uses historical data as foundational information for applying the modeling framework. Prediction of CO2 emissions throughout project completion integrates various approaches and schedules aimed at energy conservation, fleet decarbonization, and other GHG reduction activities. Using NEST, stakeholders can visualize carbon emissions, electricity consumption, and costs for decision making when planning the pathway for reaching carbon net zero. The INL＊s initiative to transition into an EV fleet was used to demonstrate the developed framework and the advantages of using NEST. It was shown that electrifying different fossil-fueled campus vehicles before 2030 with aggressive replacement schedules require high annual capital expenditure (CAPEX), which may not be available. The tool allows decision makers to test different replacement schedules and prioritize those that yield CAPEX below a certain threshold while meeting target milestones. While the demonstration focused on vehicle electrification, the developed framework lays the foundation for further quantitative analysis of other GHG reduction activities. ? 2022 by the authors.",Idaho; Idaho National Laboratory; United States; capital; decision making; electricity generation; energy use; expenditure; forecasting method; numerical model; prioritization; quantitative analysis; smart city; visualization,"J.

However, most of the existing studies generally only focus on plant variables or control variables of DESs, which may fail to explore optimal solutions. In this paper, a novel minimum-control-trajectory-deviation (MCTD) time grid reconstruction strategy is presented for the co-design approach. Three co-design approaches, namely simultaneous, nested, and direct transcription quadratic programming (DTQP) are compared using the MCTD time grid reconstruction strategy. Considering a number of design variables are time-varying in practical dynamic systems, three co-design methods use a special class of numerical analysis methods known as direct transcription (DT) that implies a ※discretize-then-optimize§ process. Motivated by the inefficiency of the traditional uniform discrete strategy, an MCTD time grid reconstruction strategy is proposed. Combining the presented time grid reconstruction strategy, simultaneous, nested, and DTQP methods are implemented for three test problems. The MCTD time grid reconstruction strategy is verified through a mathematical example, the Van der Pol oscillator, and a machine tool case. All cases have proved the superiority of presented strategy in running cost and solution accuracy.

Pinqui谷 R.; Wang H.; Noel F.,Human-Centric Co-Design of Model-Based System Architecture,2023,Procedia CIRP,1,"Model-Based Systems Engineers, particularly those moving from software to systems engineering, claim that SysML-like notations, which are symbolic two-dimensional diagrams made of boxes and lines, are domain-independent, thus very convenient to support the cross-functional design of a system architecture. However, the abstract diagramming syntax of MBSE notations makes their adoption difficult, especially by notational nonexperts, and using iconic graphics is one way of improvement. Very few studies attempted to replace 2D diagrams with immersive 3D visuals without objective evidence. We assume that it is due to a lack of quality criteria to compare 2D diagrams with 3D visuals. This paper will argue that human-centric 3D visuals should replace MBSE diagrams where appropriate. A new human-centric MBSE modelling environment motivates the adoption of interactive and immersive 3D visuals to facilitate communication and participation in multidisciplinary co-design activities from mission to concept definition. Our claim is not supported by measured evidence, but a functional demonstrator provides observed evidence and, compared to existing studies, we discuss our proposal based on the Physics of Notation. Future studies will concentrate on the modelling of the behavioural and structural views and the definition of criteria to validate the human-centric MBSE modelling environment. ? 2023 The Authors.

The requirements that serve as the foundation for these intricate systems are still primarily expressed in Natural Language (NL), which can contain ambiguities and inconsistencies and suffer from a lack of structure that hinders their direct translation into models. The colossal developments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in general, and Large Language Models (LLMs), in particular, can serve as an enabler for the conversion of NL requirements into machine-readable requirements. Doing so is expected to facilitate their standardization and use in a model-based environment. This paper discusses a two-fold strategy for converting NL requirements into machine-readable requirements using language models. The first approach involves creating a requirements table by extracting information from free-form NL requirements. The second approach consists of an agile methodology that facilitates the identification of boilerplate templates for different types of requirements based on observed linguistic patterns. For this study, three different LLMs are utilized. Two of these models are fine-tuned versions of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs), specifically, aeroBERT-NER and aeroBERT-Classifier, which are trained on annotated aerospace corpora. Another LLM, called flair/chunk-english, is utilized to identify sentence chunks present in NL requirements. All three language models are utilized together to achieve the standardization of requirements. The effectiveness of the methodologies is demonstrated through the semi-automated creation of boilerplates for requirements from Parts 23 and 25 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs). ? 2023 by the authors.",\,"A.

Laukotka F.N.; Krause D.,Supporting Digital Twins for the Retrofit in Aviation by a Model-Driven Data Handling,2023,Systems,5,"Aviation is characterized by many stakeholders, long lifespans of its assets, and high requirements regarding safety, security, and documentation. To meet these requirements as well as customer needs, aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins.

While much of the required data is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally usable dataset of the specific aircraft〞a virtual representation of the physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed information.

Then, four conceptual architectures of human-autonomy teaming were constructed, denoting traded control, executive control, combined control, and supervisory control. Finally, human-autonomy teaming was instantiated based on the systematic approaches in systems engineering. Use case analysis was carried out to sketch the components and their interactions in a typical form of human-autonomy teaming.

For the context of Permit Requirements Management (PRM), we formulate and explore four levels of explicitness for modelling requirements, ranging from document-based to model-based, and discuss how higher levels increase automation capabilities. Our early findings indicate that while model-based requirements offer the highest potential for automation, their explicitness is incompatible with current PRM processes and poses challenges for human understanding. By adopting the intermediate level of enriched text as level of explicitness for PRM instead, enabled by knowledge-graph technology, benefits of existing document-based processes are maintained. This level also offers an increased level of machine-interpretability compared to document-based permits and traceable proof of permit compliance across contexts. First explorations of these two levels suggest that enriched text is more feasible for use by non-technical users, also in terms of software solutions already available, than alternative, model-based solutions. ? 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Project management; Requirements engineering; Construction projects; Digicheck; Document-based; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Linked datum; Model-based OPC; Requirement management; Validation process; Verification process; Linked data,"B.

Zhang X.; Wu B.; Zhang X.; Duan J.; Wan C.; Hu Y.,An effective MBSE approach for constructing industrial robot digital twin system,2023,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,19,"Recently, the rapid development of digital twin (DT) technology has been regarded significant in Cyber-physical systems (CPS) promotion. Scholars are focusing on the theoretical architecture and implementing applications, in order to establish a high-fidelity, dynamic, and full-lifecycle DT model and achieve a deep fusion of real and virtual. As a typical complex system with multi-disciplines, multi-physics, and multi-domain characteristics, industrial robot (IR) involves various processes and elements from the two other levels of the system: components and production lines. Their complex relationships lead to a huge challenge to build a comprehensive DT model. Current researchers usually concentrates on single-layer services because of limited construction methodology, which results in enormous isolated models, and leads to low reusable system blocks, finite scalability, and high costs of design, adjustment, upgrade, and maintenance. To address these issues, a standardized methodology and a hierarchical, modular, and generic architecture are proposed to depict comprehensive and variable industrial robot digital twin (IRDT). Firstly, the ontology information model is presented by analyzing variable factors systematically. Then, model-based system engineering (MBSE) based methodology is introduced, including construction process and variants management. After modeling process of three levels (problem domain, solution main, and implementation domain) and four viewpoints (requirement, structure, behavior, and parameter), a generic architecture of IRDT is constructed and a feature-based variants management method is described. Besides, a six-axis IRDTS is implemented to illustrate the mapping of logical architecture and physical system as a multi-level elements and processes representation example. And the steps of numerical evaluations consist of system delay and derivation. Finally, results show the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed theoretical methodology for constructing IRDTS and other industrial applications. ? 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Architecture; Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Industrial robots; Life cycle; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Generic architecture; High-fidelity; Industrial robot digital twin; Model base systems; Model-base system engineering; Model-based system engineerings; Multi-domain modeling; Variant managements; Systems engineering,"Y.

In the past, HABs have been assessed mainly by the manual collection and subsequent analysis of water samples and occasionally by automatic instruments that acquire information from fixed locations. These procedures do not provide data with the desirable spatial and temporal resolution to anticipate the formation of HABs. Hence, new tools and technologies are needed to efficiently detect, characterize and respond to HABs that threaten water quality. It is essential nowadays when the world＊s water supply is under tremendous pressure because of climate change, overexploitation, and pollution.

Future platforms will need to compensate for one or even both pilots, which will require systems that are more reliable. However, state-of-the-art development of flight control avionics does not yet support these demands efficiently. The development process involves numerous stakeholders who are communicating without streamlined interfaces. This leads to a slow and error-prone process during development. New methods are required to improve efficiency and to pave the way for future technologies. In this work, the authors introduce a semi-automatic toolchain which derives usable code for the configuration of devices from natural language requirements. The requirements are noted through modular components, stored as a model-based configuration file and are transformed into executables in the last step. This novel approach allows engineers to input their expertise when defining requirements, while removing tedious transformation tasks.

AI promises several benefits, amongst others, beyond the state-of-the-art functions and performance. However, the use of AI-techniques also introduces new challenges regarding safety and security of systems and their certification. These challenges mostly originate from the ""black box nature"" of complex AI algorithms. To tackle the challenges, safety of the AI-based systems has to be addressed throughout the entire development and life cycle of the system. The adaption of existing methods to the development of AI-based systems is necessary. An established method for the development of complex systems is Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), which offers several advantages for the systems engineering process. In this paper three application examples of how MBSE can support the engineering process of AI-based systems are presented using an application use case: An AI-based threat localization system. First, a systematic development framework is used to design and model the AI-based system. Second, it is demonstrated how safety analysis can be integrated into a model of the system to identify potentially hazardous scenarios, which could arise, for example, due to erroneous predictions by an AI. For the analysis, an approach called Model-Based STPA is utilized which is based on the System-Theoretic Process Analysis. Third, it is demonstrated how MBSE can help in performing scenario-based safety assessment. From the operational domain model, executable configurations are generated to run scenario-based test cases. ? 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Lopez J.A.H.; Cuadrado J.S.,Generating Structurally Realistic Models With Deep Autoregressive Networks,2023,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,5,"Model generators are important tools in model-based systems engineering to automate the creation of software models for tasks like testing and benchmarking. Previous works have established four properties that a generator should satisfy: consistency, diversity, scalability, and structural realism. Although several generators have been proposed, none of them is focused on realism. As a result, automatically generated models are typically simple and appear synthetic. This work proposes a new architecture for model generators which is specifically designed to be structurally realistic. Given a dataset consisting of several models deemed as real models, this type of generators is able to produce new models which are structurally similar to the models in the dataset, but are fundamentally novel models. Our implementation, named ModelMime (M2), is based on a deep autoregressive model which combines a Graph Neural Network with a Recurrent Neural Network. We decompose each model into a sequence of edit operations, and the neural network is trained in the task of predicting the next edit operation given a partial model. At inference time, the system produces new models by sampling edit operations and iteratively completing the model. We have evaluated M2 with respect to three state-of-the-art generators, showing that 1) our generator outperforms the others in terms of the structurally realistic property 2) the models generated by M2 are most of the time consistent, 3) the diversity of the generated models is at least the same as the real ones and, 4) the generation process is scalable once the generator is trained.  ? 1976-2012 IEEE.",Job analysis; Object oriented programming; Recurrent neural networks; Software testing; Computational modelling; Generative model; Generator; Graph neural networks; Model generator; Object oriented modelling; Predictive models; Property; Realistic model; Task analysis; Scalability,"J.A.H.

Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches are well suited to address this challenge. With MBSE, products are virtually represented in central system models. For the efficient verification of customer requirements and to avoid exhaustive physical testing with prototypes, virtual domain models (e.g. FE-models) are integrated into the system model. To perform a?virtual test, domain models need to be executed in a?sequence, so-called workflows. Current workflows link several product system levels in one workflow and are often only valid for one specific system architecture. As the number of requirements and system complexity increases, these workflows become also more complex. The effort for creating new comprehensible workflows is currently high and the reusability cannot be ensured. To solve these deficits, a?method for the systematic formalization of reusable workflows in system models as well as their structured integration is presented. Behavior diagrams in the modelling language SysML are used to control the execution order of the domain models of different purposes and fidelities. Modular sub-workflows are developed for each system level. These sub-workflows can be reused and combined modularly to form larger workflows. The approach shows a?high potential to easily build and organize workflows in reusable libraries thereby supporting automated virtual testing in product development.

Nevertheless, a large quantity of knowledge is generated during the whole life cycle of complex products, and it is crucial to use this knowledge to implement iterative product design. The application of knowledge in the product design stage is mostly based on knowledge pushing from static knowledge base, which is prone to problems such as inefficient knowledge management and insufficient expression of semantic relationships, and does not combine with product iterative design scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes an iterative design knowledge pushing method combining SysML(System Modeling Language) and knowledge graphs. Firstly, the method constructs a SysML-based iterative product design system model for supporting the determination of iterative design intention scenarios. Secondly, the knowledge graph technology is used to unify the management and representation of product iterative design knowledge. Thirdly, the knowledge graph for the iterative design process is constructed oriented to the iterative feedback requirements based on FBS(Function-Behavior-Structure) and knowledge complexity calculation to determine the KDA(Knowledge Demand Anchor).

This need has brought about a paradigm shift towards Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches to system design and a departure from traditional document-centric methods. While MBSE shows great promise, the ambiguities and inconsistencies present in Natural Language (NL) requirements hinder their conversion to models directly. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has demonstrated great potential in facilitating the conversion of NL requirements into a semi-machine-readable format that enables their standardization and use in a model-based environment. A first step towards standardizing requirements consists of classifying them according to the type (design, functional, performance, etc.) they represent. To that end, a language model capable of classifying requirements needs to be fine-tuned on labeled aerospace requirements. This paper presents an open-source, annotated aerospace requirements corpus (the first of its kind) developed for the purpose of this effort that includes three types of requirements, namely design, functional, and performance requirements. This paper further describes the use of the aforementioned corpus to fine-tune BERT to obtain the aeroBERT-Classifier: a new language model for classifying aerospace requirements into design, functional, or performance requirements. Finally, this paper provides a comparison between aeroBERT-Classifier and other text classification models such as GPT-2, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and bart-large-mnli. In particular, it shows the superior performance of aeroBERT-Classifier on classifying aerospace requirements over existing models, and this is despite the fact that the model was fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. ? 2023 by the authors.",\,"A.

The impacts of these development inefficiencies are exacerbated when larger and more complex trade spaces need to be managed while encompassing the different architecture topologies and implementation options necessary to converge on a more optimal system design. This paper will discuss how Model Based Systems Engineering, specifically digital twin pipelines, can be beneficial to the product development lifecycle in a Model Based Engineering Environment. Such an approach brings modeling earlier into the design cycle, supports more perceptive system architectural and design trades, and systematic qualification. Maintaining a consistent set of system models that evolve with the maturity of the design provides an integrated and collaborative development environment that will inform detailed requirements derivation and implementation decisions towards a more capable and efficient system design. ? 2023 IEEE.",Commerce; Life cycle; Space research; Systems analysis; 'current; Engineering implementation; Model-based OPC; Model-based system engineerings; Optimal systems design; Product development process; Space exploration mission; Systems development life cycle; Technical complexity; Trade space; Product development,"R.

However, there lacks of platforms in the academic to facilitate research activities in digital twin technologies. This shortage has non-eligible and negative impact not only on advancing digital twin technologies, but also leading to scarcely publicly-available datasets for conducting research. To this end, in this paper, we present Simplexity Testbed. Simplexity Testbed is equipped with a physical model 〞 an indoor §driving ground§ featuring various driving scenarios and surface conditions, and four land rovers (named SiLaRs) of two different types. Most importantly, the digital twin model of Simplexity Testbed currently is an integration of multiple models developed with different modeling paradigms (i.e., SysML enhanced with uncertainty information, Modelica, 3D simulators for autonomous driving), which enables model executions, simulations, and cross-model interactions. The architecture of Simplexity Testbed enables future integration of other modeling paradigms. In the paper, we also share our process of developing Simplexity Testbed and lessons learnt. In addition, we put lights on how various research activities can be enabled with Simplexity Testbed. We consider that with Simplexity Testbed, context-aware, autonomous, and adaptive capabilities of digital twins can be studied, which lead to full-fledged applications of digital twins in industry. ? 2022 Elsevier B.V.",3D modeling; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Artificial intelligence learning; Machine learning techniques; Model-based OPC; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling paradigms; Physical modelling; Research activities; Simplexity; Uncertainty; Wide spreads; Testbeds,"T.

The cost overruns alone are estimated to be about half-a-trillion Dollars making it the second largest defense budget in the world. To address this problem DOD introduced the Digital Engineering initiative in 2018. Even though its vision and scope are laudable, not all the areas/disciplines involved in realizing the weapon systems are excited. There is a certain poverty of imagination in naming the vision as ※Digital Engineering.§ Most people misunderstood it to be an engineering initiative (in particular systems engineering). This paper redefines the term ※Engineering§ in Digital Engineering as a process (e.g., engineering a political coup rather than like Mechanical/Electrical/Systems Engineering), which then addresses all the five pillars of Digital Engineering. Another disturbing trend noticed by the author is that the Systems Engineering community equated Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to Digital Engineering. This prevents new thinking and thereby limits or negates the vision of Digital Engineering. This paper also touches upon the origins of systems engineering at Bell Labs, obsession with the term ※Model§ to mean anything and everything, including a text document or a static picture, and digital twins. It gives practical and useful definitions of ※Model§ and ※Digital Twin§ and provides examples and some best practices followed in developing them. It also lists some of the disruptive technologies like ChatGPT which potentially could eliminate even the need to write computer programs. These systems can fuse Unstructured, Uncertain, Incomplete, Imprecise, and even Contradictory (UUIIC) information from all sources. This will make the current processes obsolete, including the systems engineering.

This paper will contribute a framework and an entire toolchain to present a holistic and systematic approach for development of future robotic AGV systems. In the first section this paper will present the first descriptive study which is the literature survey and the definition of the scientific gaps and research questions related to systematic approaches based on Systems Engineering and Model Based System Engineering. In section number two this paper will present a new approach and framework called ※Munich Agile Concept for Modell based Systems Engineering (MAGIC)§ to develop entire virtual tool chains for virtualization and simulation of different functions in a virtual environment. This aspect is one of the important contributions of this paper. MBSE is based on three important core pillar which is 1) Methods/Processes, 2) Language and 3) Systems. The purpose of the new developed Munich Agile Concept Approach is to handle the complexity over the entire holistic information framework for simulation and virtualization of AGV function development from the system requirement definition process up to the test and validation of the system. Furthermore, with MAGIC there is a holistic approach and method to carry out the entire virtual development process by means of capable simulation and virtualization tools based on MAGICLOOP. The Munich Agile Concept contains six different levels which are System Requirement-, System Functional-, System Architecture-, System Validation-, System Test and the System-Usage-Level. For defining the first three-level, a graphical language called System Modelling Language (SysML) has been applied. The third chapter will apply the developed approach in an industrial Use Case which is based on simulation and virtualization of AGVs in a manufacturing environment. The last chapter will summaries the results of the applied Method. A lot of verification and testing are required robot and AGV development. ore the autonomous driving system can be deployed. However, testing in a real world will consume a lot of resources and may also bring security risks. Therefore, simulation is particularly important for autonomous driving systems.

Such simulation models can be gradually expanded into digital twins during system development. However, it is usually difficult to include all relevant physical aspects of the system or its context in such models. Also, the creation of such models is usually laborious. To be able to validate the system concept early without much effort and nevertheless considering the real context and physical details, in this paper the SysML model itself is used as a digital twin to control real prototypes in a real context. To create real prototypes rapidly, already existing components are re-used to set up modular systems or Systems of Systems (SoS). The presented approach has been successfully evaluated through rapid development of an SoS consisting of a drone swarm and an autonomously driving vehicle.  ? 2023 IEEE.",Verification; MBSE; Modular system; Physical aspects; Simulation model; System concepts; System development; System-of-systems; Validation; System of systems,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the complexity of modelling required to analyze an astrophysical mission based on a constellation of CubeSats. The main mission goal is to demonstrate coordinated observation of gamma ray events. Conceptual design of satellites can be successfully performed based on 1D modelling, with some interfaces to detailed 3D analysis. We set out to put together the best tools available (including PLMs) on the market for detailed 3D design. The approach has been validated while building two 3U CubeSats launched in August 2022. We investigated the classical domains of a space project: mission design, systems engineering, environment modelling, mechanical and thermal design, electrical systems, communication systems, payload simulation, electronics development, flight software, attitude determination and control system and electric propulsion. We have analyzed in detail these domains to understand what tools are used there and how we can connect them to each other. We will discuss the main difficulties encountered (model complexity, interfaces, amount of work required and last-minute changes) to establish a ※digital twin§.

Specifically, modern systems engineering processes rely on explicit models of the inputs, outputs, and interfaces of system components, as can be captured using systems modeling languages like SysML. While there is not a consensus standard reference architecture for machine learning, recently, abstract systems theory has been extended with learning theory to form abstract learning systems theory (ALST), thereby providing formal systems models of learning that are compatible with the majority of machine learning solution methods. In this paper, we apply ALST to provide explicit systems models for a cognitive path planning system in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Importantly, we consider levels of abstraction in the models of the cognitive system. We then discuss how these models enable systems engineering processes. This paper demonstrates an important application of systems theory that brings explicit systems models and model-based systems engineering into cognitive communications and aerospace applications. ? 2023 IEEE.",Aerospace applications; Air navigation; Antennas; Cognitive systems; Modeling languages; Motion planning; System theory; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Consensus standards; Explicit models; Input interface; Input-output; Machine-learning; System components; System engineering process; System models; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Machine learning,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,
Booth T.M.; Ghosh S.,Machine learning model cards toward model-based system engineering analysis of resource-limited systems,2023,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,0,"Sensor fusion combines data from a suite of sensors into an integrated solution that represents the target environment more accurately than that produced by individual sensors. New developments in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are leading to increased accuracy, precision, and reliability in sensor fusion performance. However, these increases are accompanied by increases in system costs. Aircraft sensor systems have limited computing, storage, and bandwidth resources, which must balance monetary, computational, and throughput costs, sensor fusion performance, aircraft safety, data security, robustness, and modularity system objectives while meeting strict timing requirements. Performing trade studies of these system objectives should come before incorporating new ML models into the sensor fusion software. A scalable and automated solution is needed to quickly analyze the effects on the system＊s objectives of providing additional resources to the new inference models. Given that model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a focus of the majority of the aerospace industry for designing aircraft mission systems, it follows that leveraging these system models can provide scalability to the system analyses needed. This paper proposes adding empirically derived sensor fusion RNN performance and cost measurement data to machine-readable Model Cards. Furthermore, this paper proposes a scalable and automated sensor fusion system analysis process for ingesting SysML system model information and RNN Model Cards for system analyses. The value of this process is the integration of data analysis and system design that enables rapid enhancements of sensor system development. ? 2023 SPIE.",Aerospace industry; Aircraft; Digital storage; Sensor data fusion; Systems analysis; Data sheets; Factsheet; Fusion performance; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model card; Model-based system engineerings; Resource; Sensor fusion; SysML; Machine learning,"S.

The large number of requirements inevitably results in an increased susceptibility to errors, an expenditure of time and development costs. The associated problems motivate the application of Artificial Intelligence in the form of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In Requirements Engineering one main task is the classification of requirements which serves as the input in architectural models e.g. in SysML. In mechanical engineering there is still little overview regarding the interface between requirements classification and modelling. This paper provides an overview of the requirement classes and entities used in the literature and analyses their utilisation in modelling. Existing requirements classes usually do not offer the flexibility to be transferred to other domains. However, basic structures can be adopted from those classifications. This enables a clear assignment of existing classes to object classes in modelling. Resulting from the conducted literature study the observed predominant focus of research on the software industry requires an extension of the existing requirement classes and entities to enable further use and transfer to mechanical engineering. ?

Cibri芍n E.; ?lvarez-Rodr赤guez J.M.; Mendieta R.; Llorens J.,Towards a Method to Enable the Selection of Physical Models within the Systems Engineering Process: A Case Study with Simulink Models,2023,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),0,"The use of different techniques and tools is a common practice to cover all stages in the development life-cycle of systems generating a significant number of work products. These artefacts are frequently encoded using diverse formats, and often require access through non-standard protocols and formats. In this context, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) emerges as a methodology to shift the paradigm of Systems Engineering practice from a document-oriented environment to a model-intensive environment. To achieve this major goal, a formalised application of modelling is employed throughout the life-cycle of systems to generate various system artefacts represented as models, such as requirements, logical models, and multi-physics models. However, the mere use of models does not guarantee one of the main challenges in the Systems Engineering discipline, namely, the reuse of system artefacts. Considering the fact that models are becoming the main type of system artefact, it is necessary to provide the capability to properly and efficiently represent and retrieve the generated models. In light of this, traditional information retrieval techniques have been widely studied to match existing software assets according to a set of capabilities or restrictions. However, there is much more at stake than the simple retrieval of models or even any piece of knowledge. An environment for model reuse must provide the proper mechanisms to (1) represent any piece of data, information, or knowledge under a common and shared data model, and (2) provide advanced retrieval mechanisms to elevate the meaning of information resources from text-based descriptions to concept-based ones. This need has led to novel methods using word embeddings and vector-based representations to semantically encode information. Such methods are applied to encode the information of physical models while preserving their underlying semantics. In this study, a text corpus from MATLAB Simulink models was preprocessed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and trained to generate word vector representations. Then, the presented method was validated using a testbed of MATLAB Simulink physical models in which verbalisations of models are transformed into vectors. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was assessed through a use case study.

Ontology-based Engineering (OBE) systems emerge as a new generation of Knowledge-based Engineering techniques with advancements of ontology engineering methods and computer science technologies. Ontologies enable to capture both explicit and implicit domain knowledge from historical records and domain experts.

This paper proposes a tradespace framework with Ontology-based Engineering features included on top of existing Model-Based System Engineering and interoperability capabilities. These additional Ontology-based Engineering features reuse formalised knowledge via knowledge graph technologies and generative algorithms, changing the cognitive process from the designer, to an automatic process which generates design alternatives for the designer.

Using model-based systems engineering and the modelling language SysML, harmonised requirements are documented, assigned to the new systems and targeted test cases are developed. Augmented reality experiences are then created to support the execution of the test cases during validation runs, commissioning and maintenance activities. The augmented reality experiences allow virtual information and the real environment to be linked and displayed on a mobile device.

Koh S.-J.; Chua F.-F.,ReqGo: A Semi-Automated Requirements Management Tool,2023,International Journal of Technology,0,"This study deals with issues of changes in requirements management by dealing with requirements ambiguity and prioritization. A hypothesis about the possibility of integrating machine learning techniques and requirements management processes has been proven. It highlights the efforts in automating requirements ambiguity identification, requirements classification, and prioritization considering multi-criteria in decision-making through the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Universal Sentence Encoder. Na?ve Bayes (NB) classifier has been applied with its remarkable performance on binarily classifying requirements. Although existing methods proved to improve one or two of the process significantly, it rarely integrates the whole requirements management activity. The proposed tool helps the development team to manage the requirements systematically. The prioritization algorithm is proved to work as expected by considering multiple constraints before calculating the priority value. Meanwhile, it identifies the ambiguity that exists in the requirement automatically. The ambiguity classifier successfully identifies 87.5% of requirements accurately. Possible future work could be done in improving the prioritization module by allowing automated estimation of priority value upon requirements change.

MBSE models can be designed and constructed for the corresponding unit level requirements to system level requirements using tools like MATLAB/Simulink, ASCET, etc. Once these models are made available, extracting and inferring information from these models will help in understanding on how the corresponding requirements are realized. Here, we tried to develop a technique to capture these model-related data from image files and converting them into equivalent knowledge. The knowledge is extracted, interpreted, and inferred for a given context and stored it in the form of a knowledge graph (KG). There are three major components: element detection, connection analysis, and text analysis. Here each of these components is further explained in detail. The information obtained out of these components is used to generate knowledge graphs. These KGs are further used for various applications in the V-model software development cycle. Test case generation is one among various use cases of a KG. Here brief explanation is provided on an use case where KG is used as a means to create test intents through querying. ?

Advances in digital technologies and high-fidelity digital models may lessen investments in physical models to fulfill programmatic requirements when verifying space systems. Digital engineering, model-based systems engineering, and digital twins literature link to this topic. The Integration Readiness Levels (IRL) scale is an emerging good practice that complements the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale in supporting the integration of technologies into a system. IRL has been evolving over the past fifteen years. However, IRL still provides few specific directions on the use of modeling and simulation to achieve its levels. The research objective is to propose a method that suggests whether and under what conditions modeling and simulation could comply with Integration Readiness Levels for space systems. Results show the proposed theory and how it was developed through the design science research method. The proposed method addressed model-based capabilities, system lifecycle processes, and information items in a set of suggested criteria for each IRL and additional considerations.

Liu D.; Pusarla P.; Wang Y.,Multifidelity Physics-Constrained Neural Networks With Minimax Architecture,2023,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,11,"Data sparsity is still the main challenge to apply machine learning models to solve complex scientific and engineering problems. The root cause is the ※curse of dimensionality§ in training these models. Training algorithms need to explore and exploit in a very high-dimensional parameter space to search the optimal parameters for complex models. In this study, a new scheme of multifidelity physics-constrained neural networks with minimax architecture is proposed to improve the data efficiency of training neural networks by incorporating physical knowledge as constraints and sampling data with various fidelities. In this new framework, fully connected neural networks with two levels of fidelities are combined to improve the prediction accuracy. The low-fidelity neural network is used to approximate the low-fidelity data, whereas the high-fidelity neural network is adopted to approximate the correlation function between the low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. To systematically search the optimal weights of various losses for reducing the training time, the Dual-Dimer algorithm is adopted to search high-order saddle points of the minimax optimization problem. The proposed framework is demonstrated with two-dimensional heat transfer, phase transition, and dendritic growth problems, which are fundamental in materials modeling. With the same set of training data, the prediction error of the multifidelity physics-constrained neural network with minimax architecture can be two orders of magnitude lower than that of the multifidelity neural network with minimax architecture.

Lutfi M.; Valerdi R.,Integration of SysML and Virtual Reality Environment: A Ground Based Telescope System Example,2023,Systems,1,"In recent years, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has continued to develop as a standard for designing, managing, and maintaining increasingly complex systems. Unlike the document centric approach, MBSE puts the model at the heart of system design. Among the various MBSE language development efforts, ※Systems Modeling Language (SysML)§, is the most anticipated and broadly utilized in the research and in industrial practice. SysML originated from Unified Modeling Language (UML) and follows the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM). SysML diagrams help users create various systems engineering artifacts, including requirements, use cases, operational concepts, system architecture, system behaviors, and parametric analyses of a system model. In the early days of implementation, MBSE languages, including SysML, typically relied on static viewpoints and limited simulation support to depict and analyze a system model. Due the continuous improvement efforts and new implementation approaches by researchers and organizations, SysML has advanced vastly to encompass dynamic viewpoints, in-situ simulation and enable integration with external modeling and simulation (M&S) tools. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a user interactive and immersive visualization technology and can depict reality in a virtual environment at different levels of fidelity. VR can play a crucial role in developing dynamic and interactive viewpoints to improve the MBSE approach. In this research paper, the authors developed and implemented a methodology for integrating SysML and VR, enabling tools to achieve three dimensional viewpoints, an immersive user experience and early design evaluations of the system of interest (SOI). The key components of the methodology being followed in this research paper are the SysML, a VR environment, extracted data and scripting languages. The authors initially developed a SysML for a ground-based telescope system following the four pillars of SysML: Structure, Requirements, Behavior and Parametrics. The SysML diagram components are exported from the model using the velocity template language and then fed into a virtual reality game engine. Then, the SysML diagrams are visualized in the VR environment to enable better comprehension and interaction with users and Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In addition, a VR simulation scenario of space objects is generated based on the input from the SysML, and the simulation result is sent back from the VR tool into the model with the aid of parametric diagram simulation. Hence, by utilizing the developed SysML-VR integration methodology, VR environment scenarios are successfully integrated with the SysML. Finally, the research paper mentions a few limitations of the current implementation and proposes future improvements. ? 2023 by the authors.",\,"M.

In the past, we have frequently made structures and control systems more sophisticated, which has led to rigid, monolithic production systems. However, the future must become ※lean§ in both organization and planning. technology, too! We must create the technological tools necessary to reduce planning work, hasten setup and planning, and quickly adjust to the product modifications while operations are in progress. We should incorporate smart technologies into our daily lives in order to solve these difficulties. The development of wireless communication will enable us to do away with cables. Numerous old control panels will be replaced by powerful computers or cellphones, and fragments will be replaced by abstract services byte controllable. These advances will lead not only to the mobility of people but also to the digitization of industrial systems which offers opportunities for innovation in terms of energy transition and cost reduction. To do this, autonomous systems will need to interact with their real environment, also known as a ※digital twin§. The objective of this article is to evaluate the large increase in complexity to ensure the appropriate behavior of the autonomous system during production, in order to achieve the desired production goal. This goal can only be reasonably achieved through extensive use of model-based simulation, not only during design and planning but also during other phases of the life cycle, for purposes such as diagnosis and optimization of operations.

The manual establishment of requirement traceability links is time-consuming. When faced with large projects, requirement managers spend a lot of time in establishing relationships from numerous requirements and codes. However, existing techniques for automatic requirement traceability link recovery are limited by the semantic disparity between natural language and programming language, resulting in many methods being less accurate. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained requirement-code traceability link recovery approach based on query expansion, which analyzes the semantic similarity between requirements and codes from a fine-grained perspective, and uses a query expansion technique to establish valid links that deviate from the query, so as to further improve the accuracy of traceability link recovery. Experiments showed that the approach proposed in this paper outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised traceability link recovery methods, not only specifying the obvious advantages of fine-grained structure analysis for word embedding-based traceability link recovery, but also improving the accuracy of establishing requirement traceability links.

However, currently there are few to no approaches for reusing this information in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and a graph database to analyze data from past missions and facilitate the design process of new missions. In particular, we firstly develop techniques for analysing a database of past-mission requirements. This include the ability to identify semantic similar requirements from past missions for a given new requirement. We also fine-tune a language model in order to analyse the logical traceability between two requirements. These methods are meant to enable engineers to more efficiently define the requirement space for a new spacecraft.Secondly, we also develop methods to analyse the physical and functional architectures of past missions. Based on an input for a new design, a graph database of past-mission design can be queried for similar design choices and functionalities by again leveraging the abilities of semantic similarity and a specialised breadth-first-search algorithm. Finally, we show how both the requirement and design analyses could in order to automatically verify if the provisions of a requirements are reflected in the physical architecture. For this analysis, a language model is used to extract core concepts from a requirement. Then, in a second step, the concepts from the requirement are mapped to nodes in the graph database. For the actual verification, a relevant extract of the graph together with the requirement are then used as input for a large language model, which is prompted to reason if the requirement is fulfilled or not. By leveraging NLP and graph search techniques, we believe that these approaches can lead to more efficient and effective design processes for complex engineering systems by reusing information from past designs. The proposed techniques have been developed and tested on real past-mission requirements and design architectures in collaboration with Thales Alenia Space, RHEA group, and the European Space Agency.

The primary step in automating the evaluation is in the representation of the system or systems of systems, which can be achieved in a systems modeling language. One such systems modeling language is SysML, which allows users to model a wide variety of diagram types for structural and behavioral representation. SysML leverages the Object Management Group XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) to exchange modeling data between tools. These languages can be interchanged into XMI; however, the XMI generated in modeling environments contains irrelevant information that can be refined using an algorithmic approach. Extracting these redundancies is essential to building a knowledge base of the vital components needed to replicate these XMI files outside the modeling environment using NLP strategies. Towards that end, we present XMLSlim, a robust and persistent algorithm that optimizes XML files by modifying elements and attributes without altering their meaning. By implementing XMLSlim on aerospace and electromechanical use cases, we illustrated the effectiveness of our approach with a 60% reduction in the file size while preserving their semantic meaning. This algorithm is built on reverse-engineered information retrieval techniques to assist with our ultimate goal of developing an automated model that generates SysML diagrams from the technical text. ? 2023 IEEE.",Algorithmic languages; Data mining; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Reverse engineering; Search engines; Semantics; XML; Architecture modeling; Knowledge extraction; Language processing; Modeling environments; Natural language processing; Natural languages; SysML; System models; Systems architecture; XML metadata; Modeling languages,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

Such benefits include increased data availability, data access equity, data traceability, real-Time analytics, batch analytics, and (most importantly) acceleration of the time-To-value and time-To-insights associated with engineering products and analyses. The longer-Term benefits of reusability, customization and traceability are even more promising.For Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA), and Mission Success (SMS) activities; realization of such benefits is essential to provide engineers and analysts alike vital information when needed to support critical decision making throughout the entire life cycle.

A proposal for a Universal Data Modeling Language or Datish,2023,"29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023",0,"We propose a universal conceptual data modeling language, Datish. A universal conceptual modeling language can address some of the challenges faced by modern data modeling. Conceptual data modeling seeks to represent the domain＊s substance and form, identifying the kinds of data to be collected, stored, or used, and have been effective in supporting database design. A universal modeling language can address many existing challenges in modeling practice. Since the 1970s, hundreds of modeling languages have been proposed and developed. Although some languages emerged for important classes of applications, such as entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) for relational database design, these were still limited for many use cases. As a result, hundreds of specialized conceptual modeling languages were developed (e.g., SysML for modeling systems, FAN to support administrative work). Practitioners lament the proliferation of languages, suggesting a ※universal data language§ can eliminate the modeling Tower of Babel (Western, 2022). Furthermore, existing languages struggle to keep up with the ever-expanding emerging technologies such as: artificial intelligence, social media, or NoSQL databases, data lakes (Lukyanenko et al., 2019). A general-purpose language is also needed because these technologies are often used together (e.g., AI in the context of social media). In general, modern systems never exist in isolation, and integrating systems and data across an organization can be facilitated by a universal language. These challenges can be potentially addressed by Datish - a universal modeling language capable of generic representation of data needs and data-related objects and events. To develop Datish we drew upon theories from design, linguistics, semiotics, psychology, and philosophy that specifically dealt with universal design, communication, cognition, and general composition of reality. From the theories, we formulated a set of principles underlying Datish. The principles shaped the design of specific constructs of Datish, including object, category, relationship and description as well as unique ways to use these constructs diagrammatically. The graphic representations of Datish also follow research guidance, that includes the design of visual notations (e.g., Moody, 2009), as well as existing practices and conventions in modeling. The Datish language can be effective in providing support in a variety of systems development scenarios cases (when building social media or AI systems or selecting a NoSQL database technology). Having a common language should promote communication and mutual understanding among stakeholders and facilitate deeper integration of information technologies and data, as continuously needed for emerging technologies in today＊s digitalized world. A first of a kind and theoretically grounded universal conceptual modeling language also opens novel opportunities for theoretical and empirical investigations and analysis. ? 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

Cody T.; Beling P.A.,On combining automated theorem proving and digital engineering for general intelligence,2023,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,1,"In recent years, engineering intelligent systems has become closely related to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) components into systems. There is a general sense that as the availability of computational resources scales, the intelligence of AI and ML components will scale, thus scaling the intelligence of the system as a whole. While this bottom-up approach has merit, it takes the task of engineering intelligence out of the hands of systems engineers and gives it to AI and ML engineers. In this paper, an alternative approach to engineering intelligence is outlined based on combining the concepts of automated theorem proving (ATP) and digital engineering. Instead of using AI and ML at the component-level, ATP can be applied at the systems-level to digital models and environments. By systematically solving proofs related to properties, functional requirements, and performance, ATP can contribute to the design, operation, and regulation of intelligent systems. This paper substantiates the use of ATP in digital engineering by using model-based systems engineering as an interface between the two. This paper illustrates this interface with a descriptive example in unmanned aerial systems. Ultimately, the use of ATP with digital engineering provides a top-down, systems-centric alternative to using AI and ML components as the primary means of engineering intelligence. ? 2023 SPIE",Antennas; Automation; E-learning; Engineering education; Machine components; Support vector machines; Theorem proving; Artificial intelligence learning; Automated theorem proving; Bottom up approach; Computational resources; Digital engineering; Engineering intelligence; General Intelligence; Machine-learning; Model-based system engineerings; Scalings; Intelligent systems,"T.

Tools and methods for automated trace link generation, which have been proposed so far, have no broad adoption in industry and there is lack of evidence of their effectiveness. To address these challenges we introduce a tool, which allows establishing bi-directional traceability links between requirements and model-based designs using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our tool is an extension of the Siemens toolchain for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), systems engineering, and embedded software design. It creates trace links between requirements written in natural language and CapitalTM software, AUTOSAR, SysML, UML, or Arcadia models for system/software design. This paper describes the implemented use-cases of tracing system/SW/HW requirements to system architecture models and provides an overview of the tool architecture. ? 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Kapusuzoglu B.; Mahadevan S.; Matsumoto S.; Miyagi Y.; Watanabe D.,Multi-Level Bayesian Calibration of a Multi-Component Dynamic System Model,2023,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,1,"This paper proposes a multi-level Bayesian calibration approach that fuses information from heterogeneous sources and accounts for uncertainties in modeling and measurements for time-dependent multi-component systems. The developed methodology has two elements: quantifying the uncertainty at component and system levels, by fusing all available information, and corrected model prediction. A multi-level Bayesian calibration approach is developed to estimate component-level and system-level parameters using measurement data that are obtained at different time instances for different system components. Such heterogeneous data are consumed in a sequential manner, and an iterative strategy is developed to calibrate the parameters at the two levels. This calibration strategy is implemented for two scenarios: offline and online. The offline calibration uses data that is collected over all the time-steps, whereas online calibration is performed in real-time as new measurements are obtained at each time-step. Analysis models and observation data for the thermo-mechanical behavior of gas turbine engine rotor blades are used to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Stetter R.; Gr邦ble T.; Till M.,Geometric and kinetic digital twin of a body-in-white assembly system for virtual commissioning,2023,Procedia CIRP,1,"Producing companies face enormous challenges due to increasing customer expectations, global competition and sustainability considerations. In recent years, the concept of the digital twin (DT) has found rising attention, because this concept has the potential to enable, amongst others, superior monitoring, process control, diagnosis, traceability and quality control. Additionally, the concept of a DT may intensify the integration of product development, production planning and production, because it is sensible to initiate the creation of the digital twin already in product development and the potential of this concept can only be fully realized if all phases of the system lifecycle are considered. Extensive research has already covered the application of DTs during production operation, but concerning the application in the product design stage many questions remain. The research described in this paper is focused on the question how design automation concepts can contribute to an automated creation of a DT. The paper explains a novel concept for realizing a digital twin. The novel concept is employing an engineering framework based on graph-based design languages. It is applied to an automotive body-in-white assembly system and aims at supporting virtual commissioning. The digital twin includes geometric and kinetic models and simulations and its creation already starts in product development. ? 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams. Digital Twins are an example for advanced systems shaped by high complexity. The usage of system models is therefore likely. With this contribution, a concept is presented to combine system models and Digital Twins to create a prototype for academic education and the conduction of student projects.  ? 2023 IEEE.",Condition monitoring; E-learning; Engineering education; Industrial research; Internet of things; Educational program; Hardware\software integration; Heterogeneous component; Model-based system engineerings; Model-driven; Modular modelling; New business models; Simulation model; SysML; System models; Computer software,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,1
Franch X.; Palomares C.; Quer C.; Chatzipetrou P.; Gorschek T.,The state-of-practice in requirements specification: an extended interview study at 12 companies,2023,Requirements Engineering,10,"Requirements specification is a core activity in the requirements engineering phase of a software development project. Researchers have contributed extensively to the field of requirements specification, but the extent to which their proposals have been adopted in practice remains unclear. We gathered evidence about the state of practice in requirements specification by focussing on the artefacts used in this activity, the application of templates or guidelines, how requirements are structured in the specification document, what tools practitioners use to specify requirements, and what challenges they face. We conducted an interview-based survey study involving 24 practitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies. We recorded the interviews and analysed these recordings, primarily by using qualitative methods. Natural language constitutes the main specification artefact but is usually accompanied by some other type of instrument. Most requirements specifications use templates or guidelines, although they seldom follow any fixed standard. Requirements are always structured in the document according to the main functionalities of the system or to project areas or system parts. Different types of tools, including MS Office tools, are used, either individually or combined, in the compilation of requirements specifications. We also note that challenges related to the use of natural language (dealing with ambiguity, inconsistency, and incompleteness) are the most frequent challenges that practitioners face in the compilation of requirements specifications. These findings are contextualized in terms of demographic factors related to the individual interviewees, the organization they are affiliated with, and the project they selected to discuss during our interviews. A number of our findings have been previously reported in related studies. These findings show that, in spite of the large number of notations, models and tools proposed from academia for improving requirements specification, practitioners still mainly rely on plain natural language and general-purpose tool support. We expect more empirical studies in this area in order to better understand the reason of this low adoption of research results. ? 2023, The Author(s).",Natural language processing systems; Software design; Specifications; Empirical studies; Interview; Interview study; Natural language requirements; Natural languages; Requirement engineering; Requirement management tools; Requirements documentations; Requirements specifications; State of practise; Requirements engineering,"X.

Ray A.T.; Fischer O.J.; Mavris D.N.; White R.T.; Cole B.F.,aeroBERT-NER: Named-Entity Recognition for Aerospace Requirements Engineering using BERT,2023,"AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition, 2023",16,"Organizations predominantly use natural language (NL) for requirements elicitation, development, and management since NL is easy to understand and use by stakeholders with varying levels of experience, unlike specialized model-based languages, which require training to use. However, NL requirements entail ambiguities associated with language, a tedious and errorprone manual examination process, difficulties verifying requirement completeness, and failure to recognize and use technical terms effectively. Modern complex systems warrant an integrated and holistic approach to their development to capture their numerous interrelationships. This need has spurred a trend toward model-centric approaches to engineering as compared to traditional document-based methods. Transitioning to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) requires standardized, machine-readable requirements, but the conversion of NL requirements into models is hindered by the ambiguities and inconsistencies inherent in NL. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has shown promise in facilitating the conversion of NL requirements into a format that enables their standardization and use in a model-based environment. Named-Entities Recognition (NER), in particular, can be leveraged to help address the ambiguities in NL requirements. To be of value, however, a language model needs to be fine-tuned to recognize aerospace-specific terms. To that end, we developed an annotated aerospace corpus and fine-tuned the BERT language model on the corpus to create aeroBERT-NER: a new model for identifying named entities (NEs) in aerospace requirements. A comparison between aeroBERT-NER and BERTBASE-NER showed the improved performance of aeroBERT-NER in identifying NEs within a set of aerospace requirements. The NEs identified by the model were used to create a glossary to facilitate consistent use of technical terms and language in aerospace requirements. ? 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Hassan F.U.; Nguyen T.; Le T.; Le C.,Automated prioritization of construction project requirements using machine learning and fuzzy Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA),2023,Automation in Construction,11,"Due to the emergence of risk-based verification practices, requirement prioritization has gained importance as a task in project requirements management. However, it is challenging due to the voluminous paper-based requirements, the reliance on manual content analysis and interviews, the limited focus on specific requirement types, and the neglect of the non-conformance detectability factor. This paper leverages historical data of risk priority numbers (RPN) for many written requirements to develop a novel machine learning model for requirement prioritization. The training data includes requirement statements manually annotated with professionals' ratings for three risk factors severity, probability, and non-detectability. The overall fuzzy RPN data was aggregated using fuzzy logic to tackle uncertainty in subjective ratings. The model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The study is anticipated to greatly aid professionals in prioritizing extensive textual project requirements essential for effective resource allocation that can eventually eliminate costly consequences of high-risk non-compliance. ? 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Computer circuits; Convolutional neural networks; Failure (mechanical); Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Project management; Construction contract; Construction inspection; Construction projects; Failure mode and effects analysis; Fuzzy-Logic; Machine-learning; Prioritization; Project requirement; Requirements prioritization; Risk-based; Machine learning,"T.

A flight control metaverse architecture that targets missions throughout the flight control process is built with extensive applications of AI technology. A new flight control work mode and a mission system work mode are designed to bring about systemic innovation in the flight control work mode. The former work mode features a model-based design of flight control schemes, agile and automatic implementation of mission systems, integrated flight control mission implementation, and parallel operation in physical and virtual spaces. The latter work mode comes with intelligent control, flexible deployment, and autonomous operation capabilities. The flight control metaverse presents a new mode of working space for flight control.

Zhong S.; Scarinci A.; Cicirello A.,Natural Language Processing for systems engineering: Automatic generation of Systems Modelling Language diagrams,2023,Knowledge-Based Systems,9,"The design of complex engineering systems is an often long and articulated process that highly relies on engineers＊ expertise and professional judgment. As such, the typical pitfalls of activities involving the human factor often manifest themselves in terms of lack of completeness or exhaustiveness of the analysis, inconsistencies across design choices or documentation, as well as an implicit degree of subjectivity. An approach is proposed to assist systems engineers in the automatic generation of systems diagrams from unstructured natural language text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract entities and their relationships from textual resources (e.g., specifications, manuals, technical reports, maintenance reports) available within an organisation, and convert them into Systems Modelling Language (SysML) diagrams, with particular focus on structure and requirement diagrams. The intention is to provide the users with a more standardised, comprehensive and automated starting point onto which subsequently refine and adapt the diagrams according to their needs. The proposed approach is flexible and open-domain. It consists of six steps which leverage open-access tools, and it leads to an automatic generation of SysML diagrams without intermediate modelling requirement, but through the specification of a set of parameters by the user. The applicability and benefits of the proposed approach are shown through six case studies having different textual sources as inputs, and benchmarked against manually defined diagram elements. ? 2022 The Author(s)",Graphic methods; Natural language processing systems; Professional aspects; Specifications; Systems engineering; Automated diagram from text; Automatic Generation; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Requirement diagram; Structure diagrams; System modeling language diagram; System models; Text-to-diagram; Modeling languages,"A.

To address this gap, we propose a method that combines the functional models from Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with the flow analysis models, including material flow, information flow, and energy flow. By establishing correlations between the elements of the functional model and the flow model, we develop a comprehensive digital twin functional model.

Co-simulation is an effective simulation paradigm for systems of systems such as smart grids. It relies on combining heterogeneous simulators into a coupled simulation. RL is a promising machine-learning tool for complex grid applications〞for instance, demand-side management. However, existing literature does not specifically address challenges of integrating RL with a co-simulation environment. Therefore, we focus on two challenges: how an RL agent is best integrated into a co-simulation architecturally, and to what extent typical RL frameworks are interoperable with orchestrated co-simulation tools. First, we introduce, categorize, and evaluate four approaches of architecturally integrating RL into co-simulation. Additionally, we provide guidance on selecting an appropriate approach. Second, we conduct a case study where we use and incorporate a framework-based RL agent into a co-simulation framework for a simple demand-side management scenario; we identify the need to change the control flow traditionally used in RL frameworks to achieve interoperability. In conclusion, our work is a basis for future academic or industrial applications of RL in co-simulation.

"Pereira Pessoa M., Lopes Schuch A., Bezerra J.",Using model-based systems engineering to design system-based digital twins,2023,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Although the application of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is an alternative for designing digital twins (DTs), MBSE possesses a steep learning curve, and quite often companies struggle to translate its theoretical benefits into their reality. Furthermore, the challenge of determining the DT model's fidelity, which brings balance between simulation accuracy and development costs, increases the modelling task difficulty. This paper presents the initial results from the research into facilitating the design of a system-based DT, where various models are combined to obtain the desired representation of reality. The main contribution of this paper is towards MBSE practice, where a simplified eight-step MBSE modelling approach for system-based DTs is proposed. The modelling approach begins with the existing physical product and the need for a DT and results in a simulation model that constitutes the core of an actionable virtual twin. To shorten the MBSE learning curve, a set of guidelines is proposed to delimitate the Systems Modelling Language (SysML) use in Eclipse Papyrus, and a Python parser was built to convert the SysML models' information into the simulation model. The approach, guidelines and parser are analysed via an application example. In this example, the model's creation, validation and use are illustrated. The initial results indicate that the approach and modelling guidelines provide the necessary scaffolding for simplifying and facilitating MBSE application and SysML use in the design of system-based DTs.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,1,

In a model-based systems engineering approach the system functions, their dependencies, and the allocation to the technical solution are typically documented in system models. Descriptive functions have a fuzziness that is beneficial in the solution finding process but also challenging in terms of development efficiency. To support development teams in formulation and working with descriptive functions in system design, and verification and validation phase several concepts with the use of artificial intelligence technologies are discussed.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,1

Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-To-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology. In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework. ? 2022 ACM.",Safety engineering; Software reliability; Case-studies; Enabling technologies; Hybrid reliability models; Model-to-model (M2M) transformation; Production line; Production system; Reliability assessments; Software updates; Software-defined manufacturing; SysML v2; Reliability analysis,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Christofi N.; Pucel X.,A novel methodology to construct digital twin models for spacecraft operations using fault and behaviour trees,2022,"Proceedings - ACM/IEEE 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022: Companion Proceedings",3,"Successful satellite data reception requires the nominal operation of the ground stations in charge of their health monitoring as much as the spacecrafts themselves. Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities. ? 2022 ACM.",Fault detection; Forestry; Satellite ground stations; Satellites; Behavior tree; Behaviour Trees; Digital twin; Fault tree; Fault-trees; Ground system operation; Ground systems; MBSA; MBSE; Model-based diagnose; Model-based diagnosis; Model-based OPC; Model-based operation; Operational diagnose; Systems operation; Orbits,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,1,,,

In this project a multidisciplinary, collaborative end-to-end process for virtual product design is developed. On the basis of preliminary design and concept studies on aircraft level, the process focusses on design, manufacturing and testing of aircraft systems and structural components with special attention to certification aspects. The initial use case considers the trailing edge flap of a long-range aircraft and its actuation system. Design and analysis tools are integrated in a remote workflow execution environment to automatically generate designs and evaluate them by virtual test means. Virtual tests facilitate knowledge on properties and behavior of the virtual product in early development phases and allow to optimize design flaws in consecutive design iterations to hence reduce the risk of costly corrections later in the development process. The testing is setup in multiple stages. Currently, domain-specific tests are carried out for the moveable structure and its actuation system, with the latter being in focus for the current text. These tests address the functional verification of the actuation system in nominal and failure cases. A SysML model comprising system requirements and architecture is used to model test cases and trace test results. On the basis of these test cases, simulation configurations for virtual tests are automatically built, executed and evaluated. With this method, a continuous evaluation of designs in terms of functional verification of the moveable actuation system is possible. Moreover, the automated execution of all steps allows to determine the effects of design changes quickly without a large amount of labor-intensive and error-prone work. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Product design; Testing; Virtual reality; 'current; Actuation systems; End-to-end process; Functional verification; MBSE; Model and simulation; Test case; Virtual products; Virtual testing; Virtual tests; Aircraft,"R.W.

Fend A.; Bork D.,CPSAML: A Language and Code Generation Framework for Digital Twin based Monitoring of Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems,2022,"Proceedings - ACM/IEEE 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022: Companion Proceedings",3,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are finding increasing use, whether in factories, autonomous vehicles, or smart buildings. Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots. ? 2022 Owner/Author.",Digital devices; Embedded systems; Modeling languages; Monitoring; Pipelines; Actual system; Autonomous Vehicles; Codegeneration; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Language generation; Model-driven Engineering; Monitoring applications; Multiparadigm models; Physical environments; Cyber Physical System,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,
Lu J.; Ma J.; Zheng X.; Wang G.; Li H.; Kiritsis D.,Design Ontology Supporting Model-Based Systems Engineering Formalisms,2022,IEEE Systems Journal,19,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) provides an important capability for managing the complexities of system development. MBSE empowers the formalism of system architectures for supporting model-based requirement elicitation, specification, design, development, testing, fielding, etc. However, the modeling languages and techniques are heterogeneous, even within the same enterprise system, which leads to difficulties for data interoperability. The discrepancies among data structures and language syntaxes make information exchange among MBSE models more difficult, resulting in considerable information deviations when connecting data flows across the enterprise. Therefore, this article presents an ontology based upon graphs, objects, points, properties, roles, and relationships with extensions (GOPPRRE), providing metamodels that support the various MBSE formalisms across lifecycle stages. In particular, knowledge graph models are developed to support unified model representations to further implement ontological data integration based on GOPPRRE throughout the entire lifecycle. The applicability of the MBSE formalism is verified using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Moreover, the GOPPRRE ontologies are used to create the MBSE formalisms in a domain-specific modeling tool, MetaGraph, for evaluating its availability. The results demonstrate that the proposed ontology supports the formal structures and descriptive logic of the systems engineering lifecycle. ? 2007-2012 IEEE.",Availability; Data flow analysis; Data integration; Graph theory; Life cycle; Ontology; Semantics; Systems engineering; Unified Modeling Language; Formalism; Graph objects; Knowledge graphs; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling; Object points; Ontology's; Property; Systems engineering and theories; Interoperability,"G.

Binder C.; Neureiter C.; L邦der A.,Towards a domain-specific information architecture enabling the investigation and optimization of flexible production systems by utilizing artificial intelligence,2022,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,3,"The industrial domain is undergoing a major transformation, pushed forward by emerging technologies originating from research or industry. The resulting trend, better known by the term Industry 4.0, advances automation within these manufacturing companies by providing ubiquitous interconnection. This enables the integration of technologies mainly used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) or Big Data with the goal to optimize production processes or facilitate intelligent decision-making. While those processes are progressively supported by methodologies coming from the area of artificial intelligence (AI) like machine learning algorithms, sustainable and consistent storing of production data becomes increasingly important. Concluding, production systems engineering and information engineering are correlating with each other, as the respective results could be used to the advantage of the respective other discipline. In order to address these issues while developing such flexible production systems, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been introduced. However, practical applications are lacking as this standard is mainly described in theory, which makes it difficult to actually apply this framework. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to specify a detailed architecture description of the Information Layer to ensure the practical application of RAMI 4.0, which allows stakeholders to utilize model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for developing data aspects of industrial systems on the one hand and enable Information Engineering on the other hand. Supported by the concept of the Zachman Framework, the resulting architecture is applied and validated with the help of a real-world case study. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Decision making; Embedded systems; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Systems engineering; Architecture modeling; Artificial intelligence; Domain-specific information; Flexible production systems; Industrial internet of thing; Information architectures; Information engineerings; Model-based system engineering; Model-based system engineerings; Reference architecture; Internet of things,"C.

Chen J.; Hu B.; Diao W.; Huang Y.,Automatic generation of SysML requirement models based on Chinese natural language requirements,2022,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,1,"In the face of increasingly complex systems engineering R&D, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is gradually replacing Traditional Systems Engineering, producing a significant shift in modelling language, modelling thinking and modelling tools. And SysML, as a common modelling language for MBSE practitioners, has many irreplaceable advantages. Requirements diagrams are the primary medium of SysML for conveying traceability between requirements and from requirements to structure and behaviour in a system model. Today, how to automate the construction of SysML requirements models is a significant challenge. This paper proposes an automatic SysML model generation method based on Chinese free-text requirements using natural language processing. Firstly, perform word segmentation and POS Tagging on the requirement text to construct a domain lexicon, extract effective requirements by combining the domain lexicon and regular expressions, and then mark the effective requirements with semantic roles, and determine the requirements elements through established rules, which are ultimately converted into SysML requirements diagrams. ? 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Computational linguistics; Conveying; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Automatic Generation; Model transformation; Model-based system engineerings; Natural language requirement text; Natural language requirements; Requirement diagram; Requirements modeling; SysML requirement diagram; System modeling language; System models; Modeling languages,"B.

Such a class of systems is named Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), since their design requires to merge control, network, and physical aspects. In such a context, it is fundamental to guarantee safe human-machine interactions. Therefore, evaluating and adopting techniques is necessary to ensure functional safety. This article analyzes the challenges of creating digital twins coupled with multiple classes of faults to simulate and verify the system under design. In particular, challenges can be collected under three main categories: modeling, simulation and assessment. Exploiting a language capable of capturing the complexity of such systems is necessary to model CPPSs and support the creation of digital twins. Efficient simulation of CPPSs needs different abstraction techniques and requires to combine discrete and continuous components. Moreover, different classes of faults must be injected into the models to verify the cyber and the physical parts. This would allow assessing the functional safety of each machinery composing the plant.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Complex networks; Computer simulation languages; Embedded systems; Machinery; Modeling languages; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Fault model; Fault's simulations; Functional Safety; Multiple class; Production system; Simulation; SysML language; Cyber Physical System,; ; ,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,1,,,,
Kechler N.; Sax E.,Big Data Analytics for a seamless Design Flow of reliable Automated Driving Functions,2022,VDI Berichte,0,"As part of the development of new driver assistance systems we are working on the complete and seamless life cycle of these assistance systems. We evaluate how to use and manage the amount of data which results from the increasing number of sensors and control systems in the vehicle. Big Data Analytics ensure a seamless design flow from requirements management to testing of driving functions. As a consequence, a well evaluated and safe system can be certified and quickly established on the market. One of the key elements of our presented approach is that vehicle data is analysed during simulation, testing, prototyping and operations for machine learning and quality assurance issues. The approach of data analytics in the introduced design flow includes the following main achievements: 1. A continuous process for the application of complementary analytical methods during the whole life cycle of an automated driving function is set up. This includes, for example, the identification of all requirements, the use of simulation tools, prototypes and machine learning algorithms for data generation and latest methods of testing. 2. Various sensors and the internal vehicle data are the basis of a high performance and reliable infrastructure for providing a comprehensive evaluation database. This is strengthened by ways for an efficient storage and evaluation of the data, e.g. online or backend systems. We will also present new ways to obtain data for evaluation such as the use of drones for getting additional video data. 3. Finding new use-cases for Data Analytics in the context of automated driving is one of our goals. We use big data analytics for the detection of data anomalies and thus possible malfunctions, intrusion or attacks of automated systems. This enables to handle faulty signals which increases the robustness and reliability. 4. A profitable side effect are the use-cases that offer the opportunity to use them also during operation. As an example, an increasing occurrence of data anomalies of one or more signals may indicate a component that will break down soon. Self-learning functions will optimize components lifetime. This results in cost- saving needs-based services for the vehicle, also called predictive maintenance. ? 2022, VDI Verlag GMBH.

IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions.

The Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) will be integrated into a larger Mars Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) for transit to and storage on Mars. After all Martian samples have been collected and loaded into the MAV payload assembly, MAV will deliver the samples from the Martian surface to Mars orbit. A separate spacecraft, the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) will retrieve the samples from Mars orbit and return them to Earth. To address common systems engineering challenges associated with using traditional systems engineering practices on complex projects, the MAV systems engineering team has explored implementation of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools and languages.

In support of the DoD's vision for MOSA, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) (Ref 1.) has set forth a policy that accelerates the Army's transition from its current document-driven engineering practices to the institutionalized use of modern Digital Engineering (DE) practices, to include Digital Twin and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Current DE methods and processes drive a top-down approach to development for functional system specifications derived from enterprise architectures and Family of Systems (FoS) frameworks. These and other efforts intend to satisfy another recent DoD requirement, Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) (Ref. 2). When both DE and MOSA requirements are combined, future complex systems can no longer be developed or certified as monoliths, but rather must be a collection of severable components that can be incrementally certified and deployed as an integrated whole. This paper proposes new enterprise-level governance invariants that can define MOSA components and DE interfaces with sufficient rigor to rapidly certify their modular update. The proposal aims to establish a new coordinate system for identifying onboard modules with required rigor to be useful for both analysis and certification. It aims to promote aircraft sustainability for long lifetimes in the face of modularity drivers ranging across product line, cybersecurity, and safety concerns. The result is a safe, expeditious, consistent, and affordable way to build and certify modular systems that we call Assured Infrastructure Modularities (AIM).

Interdependencies between multiple requirements identified at an early stage enable a sustainable design of the product as well as the corresponding production system by increasing process efficiency as well as the effectiveness of development processes. However, the necessary analysis of complex interdependencies between requirements of a product and the corresponding production system is time-consuming, error-prone, and highly inefficient when performed manually. Current development processes are based on such manual processes for analyzing requirements in natural language and must therefore be adapted. This paper describes a methodical approach based on a semi-systematic literature review making the complexity of the interdependencies manageable by using existing approaches and methods in the field of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as well as natural language processing (NLP). Thereby, a transition from informal requirements represented in natural language to analyzable and structured information, which enable interdependencies modeling for requirement chains, is described. A corresponding framework for analyzing interdependencies in the requirements engineering process is derived. ? 2022, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

We believe that our practices and the lessons learned can provide a useful reference for other researchers and practitioners who aim to develop a virtual assistant system. Finally, we have developed a requirement management tool, named SpecSpace, which can facilitate the management of virtual assistant projects. ? 2022, Zhejiang University Press.",E-learning; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Project management; Domain specific; Experience report; Natural language interfaces; Software project; Software project management; Software-systems; Specific tasks; Task-oriented; Tp311.5; Virtual assistants; Natural language processing systems,"T.

The development of such systems requires integrated design tasks involving many disciplines and domains such as systems engineering, safety analyses and multiphysics. Furthermore, the increasing presence of multiple and structured requirements makes the use of models inevitable during the designing phases and also strongly helpful during other phases of the system life-cycle. Besides, for a better efficiency, there is an increasing demand to have a Digital Twin of the system to be used for different purposes such as design improvements by playing different scenarios, virtual commissioning and controlling maintenance activities. In this paper, we first summarize the research context, the reference methodologies, and the emerging needs for Digital Twin creation. Then, we apply a design approach including Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Model-Based Safety Assessment (MBSA) and multi-physics modeling for the design of a collaborative workplace for the assembly of Electro-Mechanical Actuators on an aircraft wing. An operational flow to integrate MBSE, MBSA and multi-physics modelling activities is provided. Then, after having identified some relevant scientific barriers, we provide a meta-model for system models integration within a digital twin framework. ? 2022 by the authors.

Moreover, with the fast expansion of the sustainable economy, the demand for electric vehicles is expanding. In the recent age, maintenance has seriously hampered the marketing and use of electric automobiles. As a result, the technique for maintaining electric vehicles is regarded as vital since it directly affects the security and availability for the end user and the passengers. Another key aspect of electric mobility is the integration of artificial intelligence in control, diagnostics, and prognostics. Meanwhile, a lot of research efforts are still devoted to developing and innovating electric traction systems, especially for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Furthermore, topics covering important, current, and sustainability challenges should contain more than theoretical knowledge in high-quality education, particularly in engineering education. The purpose is to bridge the gap between the new technology and the learner＊s circumstances through giving practical technical expertise and training in the sphere of overall engineering competences, to avoid non-standard, unskilled maintenance work. This article presents the first phase towards designing and developing a test bench of an electric vehicle＊s powertrain used for research, learning and e-learning purposes, employing model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and systems modeling language (SysML) through the CESAM architecting and modeling framework. The aforementioned approach is used on our case study to build and present an operational viewpoint layout of the control, energy management, diagnostic, and prognostic test bench as part of the system＊s initial phase of designing the system; the test bench layout proposed in this paper represents a flexible, low-cost, multidisciplinary downsized laboratory providing basic experiments related to e-mobility and covering numerous branches and study fields. ? 2022 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; electric vehicle; exhaust emission; sustainability; technology,"H.

This competition has led to the development of new strategies to manage demand and increase market share. Among these strategies are the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products that create an increasingly complex manufacturing environment. Sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products create an environment of increased competition and constant change. Indeed, companies are trying to establish more flexible and agile manufacturing systems through several systems of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration contributes to an extension of the manufacturing system＊s life cycle by modifying its physical, organizational and IT characteristics according to the changing market conditions. Due to the rapid development of new information technology (such as IoT, Big Data analytics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing and artificial intelligence), digital twins have become intensively used in smart manufacturing.

Brown M.; Walsh D.; Nagel S.; Tiedeman H.,A Missing Piece of PEO Enterprise Architectures: The Assured Infrastructure Modularities,2022,"VFS Development, Qualification and Affordability of Complex Systems Technical Meeting",2,"As the Department of Defense (DoD) pursues the implementation of a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) to achieve weapon system overmatch through rapid and affordable technology upgrades, a more efficient and effective method to safely certify modularity is needed. In support of the DoD＊s vision for MOSA, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) (Ref 1.) has set forth a policy that accelerates the Army＊s transition from its current document-driven engineering practices to the institutionalized use of modern Digital Engineering (DE) practices, to include Digital Twin and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Current DE methods and processes drive a top-down approach to development for functional system specifications derived from enterprise architectures and Family of Systems (FoS) frameworks. These and other efforts intend to satisfy another recent DoD requirement, Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) (Ref. 2). When both DE and MOSA requirements are combined, future complex systems can no longer be developed or certified as monoliths, but rather must be a collection of severable components that can be incrementally certified and deployed as an integrated whole. This paper proposes new enterprise-level governance invariants that can define MOSA components and DE interfaces with sufficient rigor to rapidly certify their modular update. The proposal aims to establish a new coordinate system for identifying onboard modules with required rigor to be useful for both analysis and certification. It aims to promote aircraft sustainability for long lifetimes in the face of modularity drivers ranging across product line, cybersecurity, and safety concerns. The result is a safe, expeditious, consistent, and affordable way to build and certify modular systems that we call Assured Infrastructure Modularities (AIM).

Keskin B.; Salman B.; Koseoglu O.,Architecting a BIM-Based Digital Twin Platform for Airport Asset Management: A Model-Based System Engineering with SysML Approach,2022,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,23,"Airports play an essential role within the transportation and infrastructure sectors. As modernizing and expanding airport infrastructures receive a higher priority, addressing inefficiencies in capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) through transformative digital ecosystems is gaining an increasing level of interest. Building information modeling (BIM) can form a basis to enable an end-to-end digital delivery platform, where airport life cycle data can be utilized for actionable insights. This study proposes a scalable, novel BIM-based modularized platform architecture based on model-based system engineering (MBSE) principles with systems modeling language (SysML) for optimal collection, integration, management, and utilization of airport critical asset data. This platform architecture aims at acting as a metaframework that enables an airport digital twin through cohesive and structured view of asset life cycle information for insightful actions by major airport stakeholders. Research methodology features an online survey and focus group discussions for data collection; mixed method analysis for data analysis; MBSE with SysML for data mapping; and prototype demonstration and an expert opinion survey for validation. Adopting a scalable BIM-based digital platform is anticipated to result in boosts in business value of airport infrastructures by sustaining value generation in operations and decreasing upfront costs for technology implementation.  ? 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Airports; Information management; Information theory; Life cycle; Modeling languages; Surveys; Systems engineering; Asset lifecycle; Asset lifecycle management; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Digital platform architecture; Digital platforms; Lifecycle management; Model-based OPC; Model-based system engineerings; Platform architecture; Architectural design,"B.

Parkin K.L.G.,Cost-Optimal System Performance Maps for Laser-Accelerated Sailcraft,2022,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",0,"Breakthrough Starshot is an initiative to explore the Centauri system using laser-accelerated sailcraft. Earlier work produced a point design for a 0.2 c mission carrying 1 g of payload. The present work widens the design space to missions having 0.1 mg to 100 kt payload, 0.0001 c to 0.99 c cruise velocity. To make comparisons easier, assumed technology figures of merit are those of the earlier work. Also, the beam director may now draw up to 5 GW of power directly from the grid to augment the power drawn from its energy storage system. Augmenting stored energy with grid power shrinks beam director capital cost by up to 5 orders of magnitude for smaller missions, enabling new possibilities: A 0.1 mg microbiome accelerated to 0.01 c in only 4 min by a 17 cm sail and $21M beam director, expending only $12k worth of energy to do so. A 10 kg Solar system cubesat accelerated to 0.001 c (63 au/yr) by a 77 m sail and $610M beam director, expending $58M worth of energy per mission. A progression from cost-optimized point designs to whole performance maps has been made possible by replacing numerical trajectory integration with closed-form equations. Consequently, the system model computes point designs 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than before. Resulting maps reveal different solution regimes characterized by their performance-limiting constraints. The performance maps also reveal a family of missions that accelerate at Earth gravity. The heaviest such mission is a 7.4 km diameter 100 kt vessel (equivalent to 225 International Space Stations) that is accelerated for 21 d to achieve 0.07 c, reaching the Centauri system within a human lifetime. While unthinkable at this time, the required 380 PW peak radiated power (twice terrestrial insolation) might be generated by space solar power or fusion within a few centuries. Regardless, it is now possible to contemplate such a mission as a laser-accelerated sailcraft. Copyright ? 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

In this study, intersection assist (IA) function is developed to establish V2X communication in a vehicular network. Various tools are integrated into the co-simulation environment to execute the simulation. The main goal is to simulate different communication types, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), so several scenarios are created to simulate V2X communication. In Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), simulations are performed for the given scenarios which are based on model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. Controllers are built in Simulink and used to control vehicles in SUMO, while Virtual Test Drive (VTD) is used to visualize the simulation in a 3D environment. Model.CONNECT? is used to run each of these several tools simultaneously. MBSE section of this paper addresses the first major steps of system specification which are use case generation and requirement elicitation. Afterwards, specified use cases and requirements are modeled with systems modeling language (SysML) diagrams.

However, many enterprises still struggle with an efficient integration of Digital Twins into their products or production. Notably, smaller enterprises are facing a tremendous amount of effort required for the modelling and operation of Digital Twins. While less feature-rich informational Digital Twins may be viable, autonomous Digital Twins using methods of Machine Learning (ML) are unattainable for these companies due to the high complexity. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), an approach was introduced to grasp this complexity using system models e.g., SysML-diagrams. The main purpose of these diagrams is an improvement of stakeholder communication. This paper presents a novel approach to further utilize these diagrams and derive a framework for ML in the context of Digital Twins. For this purpose, system elements and data origins are directly combined with the necessary components of ML algorithms.  ? 2022 IEEE.",E-learning; Industrial research; Machine learning; Design activity; Enterprise IS; Integrating machines; Machine-learning; Model-based system engineerings; New business models; Production activity; Small enterprise; SysML; System models; Systems engineering,"F.

This highly integrated complex system consists of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Transplant Centers (TXC), patients, and their interactions. The number of waitlisted kidney candidates is nearly five times the available supply. Unfortunately, over twenty percent of donated deceased donor kidneys (supply) are discarded due to issues with kidney quality. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represent a lost opportunity. One approach is to develop a decision support system to identify the right candidate for the right donor at the right time and then communicate that analysis to various stakeholders in different locations over time. This paper uses an incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach to capture the current kidney allocation systems architecture and identify opportunities for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system to reduce kidney discard. The incremental hierarchical (top to bottom) approach was combined with model-based system engineering (MBSE) to aid in eliciting stakeholders' needs, behaviors, boundaries, and interactions. This approach led to a structured development process for the attractor 'reducing kidney discard' and facilitated systematically documenting the opportunity space. Stakeholders reviewed proposed AI decision support systems, ensuring that decision points with more significant opportunities were addressed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach is justified with a data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system validated by transplant surgeons. Future work will include developing data-driven models for all stakeholders using current data incorporating the most recent kidney allocation policy changes.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Decision support systems; Deep learning; Hierarchical systems; System of systems; 'current; Decisions makings; Evolving systems; Intelligence decision; Kidney allocation; Kidney discard; Organ placement; Placement process; SysML; Systems architecture; Decision making,"L.

This digital cabin can be used to analyse maintenance times, find optimization potential or test the integration of new technologies (e.g. hydrogen powered systems). This requires different levels of detail of the virtual cabin model as well as an automated data (e.g. 3D models, parameters) transfer infrastructure between them. However, this model structure is challenged by the complexity of the system to be mapped due to subsystems and interconnections. In addition, it requires an integration and preparation of the transmitted data (3D models, process data). This paper presents a method that addresses these challenges and introduces an architecture for building a virtual cabin for reconfiguration and analysis of new cabin variants. Model-based systems engineering is used to create a digital model of the aircraft cabin and its systems. The model is used for an automated reconfiguration of the cabin and consists of formalized knowledge and requirements. In addition, a 3D scan process is applied that digitizes the physical cabin subcomponents (e.g. riser duct) to increase the level of detail and to consider uncertainties. Subsequently, all data and models are visualized in a virtual reality environment in which users can interact with it and make direct changes to the layout. These changes are automatically transferred to the conceptual cabin design process for an automated reconfiguration and examination of the layout regarding the requirements. As a result, a baseline architecture for the digital cabin has been created, which enables fast system reconfigurability, traceability of changes, identification of interdependencies, and investigation of new cabin variations (retrofit). ? 2022 ICAS.

Radler S.; Rigger E.; Mangler J.; Rinderle-Ma S.,Integration of Machine Learning Task Definition in Model-Based Systems Engineering using SysML,2022,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),0,"In order to allow Systems Engineers to utilize data produced in cyber-physical systems (CPS), they have to cooperate with data-scientists for custom data-extraction, data-preparation, and/or data-transformation mechanisms. While interfaces in CPS systems might be generic, the data that is produced for custom application needs has to be transformed and merged in very specific ways, to allow systems engineers proper interpretation and insight-extraction. In order to enable efficient cooperation between systems engineers and data scientists, the systems engineers have to provide a fine-grained specification that (a) describes all parts of the CPS, (b) how they might interact, (c) what data is exchanged between them, and (d) how the data inter-relates. A data scientists can then iteratively (including further refinements of the specification) prepare the necessary custom machine-learning models and components. Therefore, this work introduces a method supporting the collaborative definition of machine learning tasks by leveraging model-based systems engineering in the formalization of the systems modeling language SysML. The method supports the identification and integration of various data sources, the required definition of semantic connections between data attributes and the definition of the data processing steps within the machine learning support.

Advanced artificial intelligence supporting services and improved communication capabilities are the key enabling technologies that will render future cockpits more integrated with the present digitalized air traffic management system. However, an issue in the integration of such technologies is the lack of socio-technical analysis in the design of these teaming mechanisms.

However, when one wants to 'tune' the entire production process a step further is necessary. We should evaluate performance indicators (e.g. energy and material consumption) over the whole machine life cycle in order to align the production with circular economy principles. To reach that target MBSE (model-based system engineering) should be covered by advanced digital twin approaches which allow continuous monitoring of machine performance, predict the failures and maintenance. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning must be used to process big data sets gathered from the production lines. This paper identifies a common set of technologies and building blocks suitable to solve above mentioned problems for a large variety of industrial domains (semiconductor production, health-care robotics, CNC1 machining, high-speed packaging and others). It presents the first results of the large-scale IMOCO4.E2 project and shows the pathways for application of the technology on specific machines (so-called pilots).

By the integration of external sensor technology, the system semi-automatically detects the weld seams of the assemblies to be welded. As part of real-time multi-objective optimization, the system's kinematic redundancy is used during motion execution to avoid singularities and to comply with joint limits, making it easier for the system operator to set up the welding system. The simulation models created in virtual commissioning serve as additional visual support during system setup.

Barosan I.; Van Der Heijden J.,Integration of SysML models in a 3D environment for Virtual Testing and Validation,2022,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,1,"Model-Driven Systems Engineering has been presented as a promising approach for developing complex systems. To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system's development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.  ? 2022 Owner/Author.",Computer aided design; Integration testing; Large scale systems; Systems engineering; Virtual reality; 3D models; 3d representations; 3d-modeling; Driven system; Model conversion; Model executions; Model validation; Model-driven; Model-driven system engineering; SysML; 3D modeling,,Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Ji H.; Jin Y.,Knowledge Acquisition of Self-Organizing Systems With Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning,2022,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,8,"Self-organizing systems (SOS) can perform complex tasks in unforeseen situations with adaptability. Previous work has introduced field-based approaches and rule-based social structuring for individual agents to not only comprehend the task situations but also take advantage of the social rule-based agent relations to accomplish their tasks without a centralized controller. Although the task fields and social rules can be predefined for relatively simple task situations, when the task complexity increases and the task environment changes, having a priori knowledge about these fields and the rules may not be feasible. In this paper, a multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) based model is proposed as a design approach to solving the rule generation problem with complex SOS tasks. A deep multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm was devised as a mechanism to train SOS agents for knowledge acquisition of the task field and social rules. Learning stability, functional differentiation, and robustness properties of this learning approach were investigated with respect to the changing team sizes and task variations. Through computer simulation studies of a box-pushing problem, the results have shown that there is an optimal range of the number of agents that achieves good learning stability; agents in a team learn to differentiate from other agents with changing team sizes and box dimensions; the robustness of the learned knowledge shows to be stronger to the external noises than with changing task constraints.

Manually extracting requirements from these documents-e.g., to transfer them to a requirements management tool-is time-consuming and error-prone. Today, machine learning approaches are used to classify natural language requirements and thus enable extraction of these requirements. However, in practice there is often not enough labeled domain-specific data available to train such models. For this reason, this work investigates the performance in artificially generating requirements through data augmentation. First, success criteria for a method for extracting and augmenting requirements are elicited in cooperation with industry experts. Second, the performance in the augmentation of requirements data is investigated. The results show that GPT-J is suitable for generating artificial requirements: weighted average F1-score: 62.74 %. Third, a method is developed to extract requirements from specifications, augment requirements data, and then classify the requirements. As a final step, the method is evaluated with requirements data from three industry case examples of the engineering service provider EDAG Engineering GmbH: Assembly latch hood, adjustable stopper hood and trunk curtain roller blind. Evaluation shows that especially the transferability of models is improved when they are trained with augmented data. The developed method facilitates eliciting complete requirements sets. Performance of artificial intelligence models in requirements extraction is improved applying augmented data and therefore the method leads to efficient product development.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Data mining; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Complex technical systems; Data augmentation; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Requirement engineering; Requirement management tools; Technical requirement; Requirements engineering,"I.

Rabah S.; Zacharewicz G.; Chapurlat V.,Digital Twin for Services (DT4S): Conceptual Strategy,2022,IFAC-PapersOnLine,7,"While the Digital Twin is now well discussed in manufacturing, the research considering the Digital Twin of services engineering is still in its early stage. The Digital Twin is very focused on the manufacturing operations with gathering data from physical means and information technology. Yet, services are now features and core concerns of complex systems development. However, it is not much focused on services and above all workflow orchestration to deliver these services to user whether it is an internal operator, or a customer. The engineering of Digital Twin services is a complicated phase because of the complexity of interactions and heterogeneous nature of services. The simultaneous use of models and data (e.g., Model Based System Engineering (MBSE)) should be considered for service-oriented engineering projects of complex system (large system, heterogeneous components, autonomous, etc.). Based on this postulate, the contribution of this paper is about Digital Twin and MBSE for Servitization industry. In detail, the paper proposes a recall of information systems for enterprises, workflow and servitization. Then it draws some perspectives about the interest of Digital Twin approach based on models for product service systems. It discusses the relation between service twin and ground data and the link to decision level. Copyright ? 2022 The Authors.

Modern industrial systems are highly complex consisting of multiple interrelated systems, subsystems and components. During the lifecycle of an industrial system, multiple digital twin models might be created related to different domains and lifecycle phases. The integration of these relevant models is crucial for creating higher-level intelligent systems. The Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) concept has been proposed to address this challenge by empowering digital twins with augmented semantic capabilities. It aims at identifying the dynamics and interrelationships of virtual models, thus to enhance complexity management capability and to support decision-making during the entire system lifecycle. This paper aims to explore the CDT concept and its core elements following a systems engineering approach. A conceptual architecture is designed according to the ISO 42010 standard to support CDT development; and an application framework enabled by knowledge graph is provided to guide the CDT applications. In addition, an enabling tool-chain is proposed corresponding to the framework to facilitate the implementation of CDT.

To take the novel step towards enabling full digital twins and predicting the performance of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) under untested conditions, an architecting approach is needed. A hybrid model using both physics and data-driven information about a system to capture its behavior over three layers of interest: dynamic, electrical, and thermal and a simulation-based digital testbed was explored to understand how improved testing could reduce uncertainty in model performance. This study is enabled by physical testing of an USV, data regression, modeling and simulation, and requirements management. Earlier implementation results have indicated that using a combination of physics and data driven models as the virtual version of a physical system has great potential in capturing the true performance of the physical twin and enabling accurate system-level virtual testing. It was observed that, despite error and uncertainty accumulation throughout the testing and physics model derivation, a methodology for developing a digital testbed aimed at reducing uncertainty in a future digital twin was successfully identified. ? 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this context, system reconfiguration ensures system operation and maintains system ""ilities""(e.g., reliability, availability, maintainability, testability, and safety). This research has been conducted in the context of a large international aerospace, space, ground transportation, defense, and security company. This research aims at supporting system reconfiguration during operations. Within current industrial practices, the development of reconfiguration support is challenging as it requires integrating data related to observations (from operations) and system design (from engineering). More specifically, there is a need to integrate and link relevant reconfiguration data concerning the system objectives, operational context, and level of functioning. This paper proposes integrating and linking this fundamental data within a reconfiguration method. MBSysRec is a multidisciplinary method that involves configuration generation and a multicriteria decision-making method for configuration evaluation and selection to support system reconfiguration during operations. The method has been implemented on two projects based on historical data. Resulting configurations have been discussed and assessed by system reconfiguration experts.

To create an intelligent Digital Twin, the Digital Twin architecture must also include software services that support machine learning algorithms. These software services must have two characteristics. First, an interface to the real environment to dynamically receive feedback from an existing product or a product under development. Second, machine learning algorithms that analyze and manage the Digital Twin's models based on feedback from the real product. In this paper, we present the concept and implementation of a software service within the intelligent Digital Twin＊s architecture for automated requirements modeling as well as for modeling of the product system architecture. Since medical devices differ significantly in their applied technology, area of use, and application, the requirement engineering of medical devices needs to identify and specify the critical design requirements for each product individually.

Technical systems in particular are undergoing major changes. Tomorrow's systems are characterized by their autonomy, high level of interconnection, and socio-Technical interfaces. These systems can no longer be developed by one engineering discipline alone, but require interdisciplinary development teams. This type of development requires a high degree of collaboration, communication, and orchestration. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) supports engineers in the interdisciplinary development of future systems. MBSE uses models to generate a unified and complete view of the system. This allows changes to be easily tracked and the visualization helps to understand the system discipline-independent. The creation of these models still requires high effort. New AI technologies can be used to derive potential assistant systems in the context of MBSE. This paper shows realized examples of AI-based assistance systems. They are motivated by the experience of using MBSE in research and development projects with high complexity and inter-disciplinarity.

Hein P.H.; Kames E.; Chen C.; Morkos B.,Reasoning support for predicting requirement change volatility using complex network metrics,2022,Journal of Engineering Design,10,"Due to inevitable design iterations, requirements are frequently changed and revised. If not effectively managed, undesired propagating changes may result in monetary and time losses, leading to project failure. Current requirement management tools lack formal reasoning for characterising change and its propagation. Based on prior research that suggests that requirement networks can be utilised to study change propagation and that requirement change volatility (RCV) can be measured through four classes: namely, multiplier, absorber, transmitter, and robust, which are defined based on how requirements behave to the initial change. This research investigates if complex network metrics can be used to predict RCV using computational methods. The RCV class metrics of each requirement are determined using industrial data and requirement relationships obtained from networks of a previously developed Refined Automated Requirement Change Propagation Prediction (R-ARCPP) tool. Complex network metrics are also computed for each requirement in the network. Regression analysis models, specifically ordinal output cumulative logit regression models employing information criterion based genetic algorithm model selection, and artificial neural network models, specifically backpropagation artificial neural networks, are employed to predict RCV using complex network metrics. Best performing models are discussed along with the limitations, conclusions, and future direction of this research. ? 2022 The Author(s).

The temperature change, overcharging and over-discharging, is playing critical roles in affecting battery life in a significant manner. In this paper, the deep learning-based method is applied for the prognostics of a single Li-ion battery. The proposed design uses a recurrent neural network variant, long每short-term memory. The model＊s parameters are optimized through a genetic algorithm-based parameter selector. The method applies to a sequence of data values comprising of the voltage, the charge capacity, the current, and the temperature. The estimation of battery capacity is not only based on the current or defined state of battery, instead, it is generated on the complete data profile. The robustness of the model is tested by comparing it with techniques such as support vector regressor, Kalman filter, and neural networks on normal and noisy test sets. The paper also proposes a feature selection and engineering scheme for battery capacity prediction. The proposed model outperforms the techniques available in the literature with high generalization to noise and other perturbations. The model is independent of the section of the charging curve used for the prediction of battery capacity. Various experimentation has been conducted on the model and the; results have been validated. ? 2022 by ASME.",Big data; Forecasting; Lithium-ion batteries; Long short-term memory; Support vector machines; 'current; Battery capacity; Battery capacity predictions; Big data and analytic; Data driven; Data-driven engineering; Engineering applications; Model-based system engineerings; Process modeling for engineering application; Process-models; Genetic algorithms,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),Article,Scopus,,,,,1,,,
G?llner D.; Rasor R.; Anacker H.; Dumitrescu R.,Collaborative Modeling of Interoperable Digital Twins in a SoS Context,2022,Procedia CIRP,9,"In an Industry 4.0 compliant production plant components from different value chain partners must work together. Digital Twins (DTs) are an essential part of that system of systems because all relevant assets will need those digital representations to be integrated into such kind of environment, as they establish the required flexibility for formerly rigid structures. This does not begin at the time of delivery of products but already during engineering of the production plant, where relevant data and information are needed. The DT topic is not exclusively a software topic, as it cannot be considered without the associated physical twins. This leads to a need for a holistic Model-Based Systems Engineering approach that integrates all necessary aspects into an architecture for interoperable DTs. This contribution presents an approach and guidelines for modeling DTs based on industry use cases. The goal is to support the implementation of interoperable DTs in Industry 4.0 by using formal modeling techniques. This closes the gap between informal discussions about DTs between value chain partners and the implemented interoperable DTs needed for a specific use case. Compatibility with emerging standards such as the asset administration shell is assured. Focus is the modeling of the DT environment, e.g. a production plant as a system of systems as well as the description of logical DT content elements. Main elements in the environment of a DT are other linked DTs, their relationships and interactions. Users of the modeling approach are developers or management responsible for the company's DTs. They can use it to develop the correct DTs for relevant use cases of their assets. ? 2022 The Authors.

Weigand M.; Fay A.,Creating Virtual Knowledge Graphs from Software-Internal Data,2022,IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference),3,"Due to their capability to model information about various domains in a semantically rich way, knowledge graphs gain importance in the engineering of automated systems. Still, the integration of engineering artifacts, which are usually created by software, is a challenge, due to missing interfaces of engineering software. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting information directly from running engineering software. The core concept of this method are virtual graphs, which do not physically store data, but instead have capabilities to access data from the software's internal information model on demand. This information can then be accessed by other engineering software, which avoids typical, tedious workflows consisting of data exports and imports from and to different tools. For this concept, a generic concept and an architecture for a landscape of engineering tools are presented. They are validated by a prototypical implementation, which creates a virtual graph of the internal data of a SysML-tool and makes it accessible by a graph database. ? 2022 IEEE.",Automation; Graph Databases; Knowledge graph; Ontology; Virtualization; Automated systems; Engineering software; Extracting information; Knowledge graphs; Model informations; Ontology's; SysML; Virtual graph; Virtual knowledge; Virtualizations; Data integration,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,

Li H.; Wang G.; Lu J.; Kiritsis D.,Cognitive twin construction for system of systems operation based on semantic integration and high-level architecture,2022,Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering,15,"With the increasing complexity of engineered systems, digital twins (DTs) have been widely used to support integrated modeling, simulation, and decision-making of the system of systems (SoS). However, when integrating DTs of each constituent system, it is challenging to implement complexity management, interface definition, and service integration across DTs. This study proposes a new concept called cognitive twin (CT) to support SoS development and operation. CTs have been defined as DTs with augmented semantic capabilities for promoting the understanding of interrelationships be-tween virtual models and enhancing the decision-making. First, CTs aim to integrate the information description of DTs across constituent systems using a unified ontology and semantic modeling technique. Second, CTs provide integrated simulations among DTs for decision-making of the SoS based on a high-level architecture (HLA). Finally, through reasoning ontology models, CTs provide decision-making options for the operations of real constituent systems. A case study on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) landing on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is used to verify the flexibility of this approach. From the results, we find that the CT based on the proposed ontology provides a unified formalism of DTs across UAVs and USVs. Moreover, the reasoning based on the CT provides decision-making capabilities for UAVs by implementing cognitive computing to select target USVs for landing.  ? 2022 - IOS Press.

This methodology is based on SysML language and artificial intelligence tools such as conceptual graphs and Bayesian networks, and involves the construction of an information design model that contains knowledge about the requirements for the system being designed and a knowledge base of available technical solutions. Further, such an information model is used for automatic logical inference of technical solutions according to the requirements specified by the designer. The proposed methods and tools for design automation make it possible to trace the requirements for electromechanical systems at all stages of design, and evaluate the robustness of technical solutions to changes in these requirements. For quick and efficient implementation of the proposed methodology in the practice of industrial design, it must be verified by evaluating the degree of efficiency, completeness, consistency and feasibility of the synthesized design solutions, the convenience of using artificial intelligence tools in the course of solving typical industrial equipment design problems. For this purpose, a configurable laboratory stand was built, which is a physical model of a simple workcell of an industrial manufacturing system. The stand performs the typical functions of a workpieces sorter, has a modular design, and can include the implementation of specified functional requirements by various technical means. Thus, it is possible to obtain different configurations of the sorting device having differences in the sequence of operations and technical properties. To automate the design of these configurations using the CoGui software tool, an information model was created that compares the possible system requirements for the stand with suitable variants of technical solutions. This model is used to automatically obtain descriptions of stand configurations. The performance and other properties of the resulting configurations were then tested on the operating equipment of the stand.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Bayesian networks; Computer aided design; Curricula; Design for manufacturability; Information theory; Knowledge based systems; Manufacture; Semantics; Artificial intellegence; Conceptual graph; Design Methodology; Electromechanical systems; Laboratory stand; Requrement; Semantics networks; Technical solutions; Workpiece; Workpiece sorter; Product design,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,

Romero V.; Pinqui谷 R.; No?l F.,A user-centric computer-aided verification process in a virtuality-reality continuum,2022,Computers in Industry,4,"Although companies systematically strive for a full digitalisation of their products and their processes, the design phase shows that the quality of models is very unequal. Indeed, detailed design benefits from much more sophisticated methods and tools than the specification and architecture activities. Although, we should note the recent paradigm shift from document-based to model-based systems engineering, these models, which are mainly static 2D diagrams, remain poor to facilitate design verification early on. Thus, to detect most errors during the design phase, companies have no other alternative than to wait up to the testing phase which occurs after several years of development for complex systems. Thus, we propose a user-centric computer-aided verification process to ensure that the design meets the requirements under realistic operational conditions. The verification process provides a progressive immersion into the virtual system before seamlessly transitioning to the real system. Our work is built upon state-of-the-art MBSE methods such as the Property Model Methodology, which enables systems engineers to co-simulate specification models and design models. We improve such MBSE methods by increasing the level of realism that experiences the end-user during the verification of a design by the original combination of Model-In-the-Loop, Immersive Model-In-the-Loop, Human-In-the-Loop, and Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation strategies.

Machin P.,Digital Requirement Development: Three Years of Using Digital Methods to Improve Standardization of Procurement Specifications,2022,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,0,"Joint Industry Program 33 (JIP33) was established through IOGP with backing from the World Economic Forum to drive industry level standardization for procurement of equipment and packages. During Phases 1 and 2 of JIP33 the traditional business applications Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and e-mail were used to develop, collaborate and publish 14 specifications. For phase 3 a digital requirements management platform was implemented to enhance capacity, efficiency and auditability of specification development and maintenance. This platform has subsequently been used to develop and publish 27 ＆exception＊ style specifications and 4 ＆narrative＊ style specifications, bringing the JIP33 published specification library to 45 since the program's commencement in 2016. JIP33 proposed that the adoption of a digital requirements management platform would reduce the cost and time of development, simplify collaboration and improve the quality and maintainability of output. The platform's original configuration and work processes have evolved to enhance collaboration and improve traceability. Natural language processing technology has been integrated into the platform to support JIP33 writing protocols and reduce user dependence on external tools. Document production is automated using customised data transformations to output the specifications in a publishable form. Requirement Interchange Format (ReqIF) data exports are being piloted in collaboration with the IOGP Standards committee to test the digital transfer of JIP33 specifications into user databases. Changes to JIP33 work processes aimed at improving user engagement also provided resilience to the Covid pandemic and the sudden shift globally to virtual working. However, notwithstanding improvements in the tools and process, timely engagement of collaborators in content development and reviews remains a significant area for improvement. Resistance to ＆sentence centric＊ requirement writing should decline as familiarity and culture change programs take effect. Improvements to JIP33 data transformations are predicted to streamline extraction of publishable specification documents from the platform. Digital transfer of JIP33 specifications has also been piloted and advances in the standardisation of data attributes across the industry will drive the future evolution of the JIP33 program's use of these tools.

Nadeem M.A.; Lee S.U.-J.; Younus M.U.,A Comparison of Recent Requirements Gathering and Management Tools in Requirements Engineering for IoT-Enabled Sustainable Cities,2022,Sustainability (Switzerland),3,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that facilitates the proliferation of different devices such as sensors and Radio Frequency Identification (RFIDs) for real-time applications such as healthcare and sustainable cities. The growing popularity of IoT opens up new possibilities, and one of the most notable applications is related to the evolving sustainable city paradigm. A sustainable city is normally designed in such a way to consider the environmental impact and a social, economic, and resilient habitat for existing populations without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same, while the process of managing project requirements is known as requirements management. To design a high-quality project, effective requirements management is imperative. A number of techniques are already available to perform the requirement gathering process, and software developers apply them to collect the requirements. Nevertheless, they are facing many issues in gathering requirements due to a lack of literature on the selection of appropriate methods, which affects the quality of the software. The software design quality can be improved by using requirements capture and management techniques. Some tools are used to comprehend the system accurately. In this paper, a qualitative comparison of requirements-gathering tools using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and requirements-management tools is presented for sustainable cities. With all the tools and techniques available for capturing and managing requirements, it has been proven that software developers have a wide range of alternatives for selecting the best tool that fits their needs, such as chosen by the AI agent.

Autonomous and remote operation of physical assets can provide numerous benefits to organizations and industries that deal with complex and distributed systems. The automation of the operation of a physical asset can be achieved through a digital twin, connected to the inputs and outputs of the asset and using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Development of the digital twin requires understanding of systems interfaces and incorporating this understanding in digital systems. The effort described herein aims to determine the feasibility and benefit of such a process through the development and evaluation of a digital twin connected to a heat-pipe test-bed environment. Many challenges need to ultimately be addressed by a digital twin including data quality, infrastructure, privacy and security, and more.

This vision paper discusses the role of AI in solving a set of MBSE challenges. As a result, we contribute by describing the actual MBSE adoption challenges and follow up with the characterization of the capabilities of AI in solving these challenges. With this initial work, we aim to trigger both AI and MBSE communities for further research discussions and industrial applications to help in achieving an intelligent design and development environment.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,
"Abdoun N., Chami M.",Automatic Text Classification of PDF Documents using NLP Techniques,2022,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"One of the regular activities performed by engineers during the design and development of the technical systems is to determine which sentences in a PDF specification document represent a requirement, functional architecture, design solution, variability, or other types of systems engineering (SE) data. Extracting such data from these PDF documents and transferring it into system model elements is still performed manually, requires high effort, and is error prone. Hereby, automatic extraction and classification of such SE data has a great potential, but it is still relatively scarce and a challenging task for engineers working with large PDF specification documents. One solution is to follow a suitable writing formulation which provide an immediate and easy way to classify and analyze the PDF documents. However, such formulations are not always followed strictly. As part of our work towards adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), we have been researching the data extraction and data classification topics from PDF files in order to transfer it to system models elements. In this paper, we present the early status of a solution based on AI that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to label the SE data existing in PDF files, extract them, and classify them into predefined classes.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,
"Kulcs芍r G., Constant O., Pruvost G., R芍th I., F邦zesi M., Harmath D.",Natural Language Understanding of Systems Engineering Artifacts,2022,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"This paper examines in close relation two fields of growing importance: model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and natural language processing (NLP). System models provide a structured description of engineering data, whose inherent semantics often remains hard to explore. Natural language understanding, (i.e., the machine analysis of texts produced by humans) an important field of NLP, focuses on semantic text comprehension but cannot directly account for structured information sources. In this paper, we investigate natural language understanding of MBSE artifacts as they appear in industrial scenarios. In this context, the wide and heterogeneous knowledge space and user base calls for novel techniques to facilitate information retrieval from complex system models. We thus propose to leverage domain-specific text generators to transform models into a descriptive text corpus on which we apply state-of-the-art semantic search and analysis techniques. We illustrate the approach on relevant MBSE examples by performing a qualitative evaluation of intuitive text search and comprehension in textual descriptions obtained from system models.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,
"Chen M., Bhada S.",Converting natural language policy article into MBSE model,2022,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"System Engineers work on designing human interfaces for easy access to governance and technology. As we move to digital engineering, the policy documents are still written in natural language that sometimes is obscure and verbose. One way of digitizing is to convert natural language policies into machine readable system engineering models. In the past, converting natural language written policy documents into machine readable models involves great human effort and expert knowledge in relevant domains, which is a time consuming, tedious, and sometimes impossible task. Artificial Intelligence and its application have shown the potential to accelerate the process. In this study, we proposed a natural language processing (NLP)-based framework for information extraction under the general condition that can automatically detect the actors and their responsible actions. To validate the performance of the model developed, we compared the NLP generated report with manually created SysML model. The result shows that the precision and recall rate of extracting roles and responsibility is ~0.86 and ~0.66, respectively, representing that this text-to-model framework has the potential to accurately convert general policy documents into SysML.",Natural language processing (NLP); Information extraction (IE); Rule-based NLP; Model-based System-engineering (MBSE); SysML,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,
"Georgsen R., K?ien G.",Serious Games with SysML: Gamifying Threat Modelling in a Small Business Setting,2022,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"This paper describes using casual games to capture and disseminate expert security knowledge with a digital model at a small company. Most companies in the global supply chain are Very Small Entities (VSE), meaning they employ five (5) to twenty-five (25) people. These companies represent a risk because they have little to no security proficiency and limited resources and incentive to prioritize system security. Moreover, this is a hidden risk because the companies higher up in the supply chain rely on contractual mechanisms to enforce compliance with security requirements. Small companies rely on informal methods in their daily work and are resistant to change. Threat modelling in the context of Agile Model-Based Systems Engineering (AMBSE) can provide VSEs with a structure that allows them to retain their informal operational agility. When modelling using games, the security expert plays the dual role of modeler and educator, and the engineering team is gaining security proficiency, improving the quality of both their current and future work. Players reported improved understanding of other stakeholders' perspectives. Agility, proficiency, and stakeholder alignment are among the critical foundation concepts identified by the INCOSE led Future of Systems Engineering Initiative (FuSE) to improve system security.",System Security Engineering; Very Small Entities; Threat Modelling; Serious Games,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,
"Houck K., Ritter C., Burnett T., Cavaluzzi J,",Beartooth: Nuclear material testbed with MBSE and digital twin,2022,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Digital engineering can fundamentally change the construction and operation of complex projects. Traditional engineering teams operate in siloed tools and disparate teams. Throughout a project lifecycle, data is translated manually or over brittle point-to-point connections, which increases the risk of silent errors. These potential errors can cascade across the effort, resulting in significant project delays and cost overruns. Furthermore, traditional engineering projects are not designed for the rapid digitization that allows for advanced analytic tools. Digital engineering can create a cohesive data ?source of truth? to ensure a project is designed for the digital future. There is a need for a standard toolset to normalize and integrate project datasets. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed DeepLynx, a crucial tool to mitigate this data management problem. This paper introduces INL's digital engineering approach and provides a concrete example of a digital engineering design effort currently taking place with Beartooth, a new nuclear material processing testbed project. This paper will provide the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned in using digital engineering on this complex system.

The aim of the original model was to design and integrate an architecture of digital twins derived from business needs that leveraged the potential of the synergies in the ecosystem. The conceptual framework presented in this paper extends the semantic ontology model for integrating the digital twins. For the original model, technical modeling approaches were developed and integrated into an ecosystem perspective based on a modeling of the ecosystem and the actors＊ decision jobs. In a service ecosystem comprising several enterprises and a multitude of actors, decision making is based on the interlinkage of the digital twins of the equipment and the processes, which is achieved by the semantic ontology model further elaborated in this paper. The implementation of the digital twin architecture is shown in the example of a manufacturing SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) case that was introduced in. The mixed semantic modeling and model-based systems engineering for this implementation is discussed in further detail in this paper. The findings of this detailed study provide a theoretical concept for implementing digital twins on the level of service ecosystems and integrating digital twins based on a unified ontology. This provides a practical blueprint to companies for developing digital twin based services in their own operations and beyond in their ecosystem. ? 2021 by the authors.

Rodionov N.; Tatarnikova L.,Digital twin technology as a modern approach to quality management,2021,E3S Web of Conferences,5,"The concept of a digital twin and its types are discussed in this paper. The essence of the development of digital twins in the SysML language, the use of AnyLogic (simulation software) and the use of MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems) software for communication with production systems are described. The functions of neural technologies that can be integrated into a modern QMS (quality management system) are considered. The use of digital twins in the quality management system allows monitoring inconsistencies in the technological component of production and quickly eliminating them, and also offers solutions to the identified problem. Companies are now finding a competitive advantage in digital technologies, especially digital twins, whose economic benefits are undeniable. The quality management system of enterprises with high-tech industries is more and more moving into the analysis of big data and in interaction with the digital environment. Thus, it is so important to pay attention to technologies directly related to the analysis of the quality of the product and the processes of its creation. As a result of the study, a clear connection between advanced information technologies and the development of the quality management system of enterprises was revealed. ?

Faced with the complexity, one of the core issues that companies care about is how to effectively evaluate, predict, and manage it in the early system design stage. The inaccuracy of contemporary complexity measurement approaches still exits due to the inconsistency between the actual design process in physical space and the theoretical simulation in virtual space. Digital Twin (DT) provides a promising way to alleviate the problem by bridging the physical space and virtual space. Aiming to integrate DT with MBSE for the system design complexity analysis and prediction, based on previous work, an integration framework named System Design Digital Twin in 5 Dimensions was introduced from a knowledge perspective. The framework provides services for design complexity measurement, effort estimation, and change propagation prediction. Then, to represent the system design digital twin in a unified way, a modeling profile is constructed through SysML stereotypes. The modeling profile includes System design digital model in virtual space profile, system services profile, relationships profile and digital twin data profile.

Brusa E.,Digital Twin: Toward the Integration Between System Design and RAMS Assessment Through the Model-Based Systems Engineering,2021,IEEE Systems Journal,12,"The design of a safety-critical system requires an effective prediction of its reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS). Anticipating the RAMS analysis at the concept design helps the designer in the tradeoff of the system architecture and technologies, reduces the cost of product development and the time to market. This action is rather difficult, because the RAMS analysis deals with the hazard assessment of system components, whose abstraction at concept level is never simple. Therefore, to integrate the system design and RAMS assessment, a clear path to follow is required. This article investigates how the model-based systems engineering supports this task and drives the system reliability allocation, through the functional and dysfunctional analyses. The implementation of the proposed approach needs to set up the tool chain. In the industrial context, it must be compatible with practices, standards, and tools currently used in product development. Defining a suitable process of integration of tools used for the system design and the safety engineering is a need of the industry.

Kravari K.; Antoniou C.; Bassiliades N.,Sense: A flow-down semantics-based requirements engineering framework,2021,Algorithms,2,"The processes involved in requirements engineering are some of the most, if not the most, important steps in systems development. The need for well-defined requirements remains a critical issue for the development of any system. Describing the structure and behavior of a system could be proven vague, leading to uncertainties, restrictions, or improper functioning of the system that would be hard to fix later. In this context, this article proposes SENSE, a framework based on standardized expressions of natural language with well-defined semantics, called boilerplates, that support a flow-down procedure for requirement management. This framework integrates sets of boilerplates and proposes the most appropriate of them, depending, among other considerations, on the type of requirement and the developing system, while providing validity and completeness verification checks using the minimum consistent set of formalities and languages. SENSE is a consistent and easily understood framework that allows engineers to use formal languages and semantics rather than the traditional natural languages and machine learning techniques, optimizing the requirement development. The main aim of SENSE is to provide a complete process of the production and standardization of the requirements by using semantics, ontologies, and appropriate NLP techniques. Furthermore, SENSE performs the necessary verifications by using SPARQL (SPIN) queries to support requirement management. ? 2021 by the authors.

MBDs can potentially eliminate error-prone information exchange associated with traditional paper-based drawings and improve the fidelity of component details, captured using 3D CAD models. A component's behavior during its lifecycle stages influences its downstream performance, and if included within the MBD of a part, could be used to forecast performance upfront during the design and explore newer designs to enhance performance. However, current CAD capabilities limit associating behavioral information with the component's shape definition. This paper presents a CAD-based tool to store and retrieve metadata using point objects within a CAD model, creating linkages to spatial locations within the component. The tool is illustrated for storage and retrieval of bulk residual stresses developed during the manufacturing of a turbine disk acquired from process modeling and characterization. Further, variations in residual stress distribution owing to process model uncertainties have been captured as separate instances of the disk's CAD models to represent part-to-part variability as an analogy to track individual serialized components for digital twins. The propagation of varying residual stresses from these CAD models within the damage tolerance analysis performed at critical locations in the disk has been demonstrated. The combination of geometric and non-geometric data inside the MBD, via storage of spatial and feature varying information, presents opportunities to create digital twin(s) of actual component(s). ? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

As ML models become more structurally complex, many systems have struggled to provide all-round performance on a variety of models. Particularly, ML scale-up is usually underestimated in terms of the amount of knowledge and time required to map from an appropriate distribution strategy to the model. Applying parallel training systems to complex models adds nontrivial development overheads in addition to model prototyping, and often results in lower-than-expected performance. This tutorial identifies research and practical pain points in parallel ML training, and discusses latest development of algorithms and systems on addressing these challenges in both usability and performance. In particular, this tutorial presents a new perspective of unifying seemingly different distributed ML training strategies. Based on it, introduces new techniques and system architectures to simplify and automate ML parallelization. This tutorial is built upon the authors' years' of research and industry experience, comprehensive literature survey, and several latest tutorials and papers published by the authors and peer researchers. The tutorial consists of four parts. The first part will present a landscape of distributed ML training techniques and systems, and highlight the major difficulties faced by real users when writing distributed ML code with big model or big data. The second part dives deep to explain the mainstream training strategies, guided with real use case. By developing a new and unified formulation to represent the seemingly different data- and model- parallel strategies, we describe a set of techniques and algorithms to achieve ML auto-parallelization, and compiler system architectures for auto-generating and exercising parallelization strategies based on models and clusters. The third part of this tutorial exposes a hidden layer of practical pain points in distributed ML training: hyper-parameter tuning and resource allocation, and introduces techniques to improve these aspects. The fourth part is designed as a hands-on coding session, in which we will walk through the audiences on writing distributed training programs in Python, using the various distributed ML tools and interfaces provided by the Ray ecosystem.  ? 2021 Owner/Author.",Clustering algorithms; Computer architecture; Computer software; Data mining; Industrial research; Auto-parallelization; Computational nodes; Distributed machine learning; Distribution strategies; Parallelization strategies; System architectures; Training techniques; Unified formulations; Machine learning,,Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,1,,,,

For electric drive requirements modeling SysML language is used. Further obtained model is converted into a semantic network in the form of a conceptual graph (CG). This graph has a mathematical description in the form of logical expressions and can be used by an inference machine for automatic analysis and synthesis of technical solutions.

To take into account the inconsistency of the requirements, the model in form of conceptual graph is transformed into description necessary for applying the GORE methodology tools.

Myllynen S.; Suominen I.; Raunio T.; Karell R.; Lahtinen J.,Developing and Implementing artificial intelligence-based classifier for requirements engineering,2021,Journal of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science,4,"In nuclear power plant (NPP) projects, requirements engineering manages the sheer volume of requirements, typically characterized by descriptive and nonharmonized requirements. Large projects may have tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of requirements to be managed and fulfilled. Two main issues impede requirements analysis: tortuous requirements to be interpreted; and humans＊ very limited ability to concentrate on a specific task. It has therefore been recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to support designers＊ decision making in classifying and allocating NPP requirements into predefined classes. This paper presents our work on developing an AI-based requirements classifier utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine-learning (ML). In addition, the paper presents the integration of the classifier with the requirements management system. The focus is on the classification of nuclear power industry-specific requirements utilizing deep-learning-based NLP. Three classifiers are compared, and the corresponding results are presented. The results include predetermined requirement classes, manually gathered and classified data, a comparison of three models and their classification accuracies, microservice system architecture, and integration of the established classifier with the requirements management system. As the performance of the requirements classifier and related system has been successfully demonstrated, future AI-specific development and studies are suggested to focus on atomizing multiclass requirements, combining similar requirements into one, checking requirements syntax, and utilizing unsupervised learning for clustering. Furthermore, new and advantageous requirement classes and hierarchies are suggested for development while improving current datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Tolchinsky I.,Systems Level Trade Studies with CAE Data,2021,SAE Technical Papers,0,"This paper describes the method of performing systems level architecture trade studies using data from high fidelity CAE calculations. The method is applied to a SysML model of an IRS Rear Axle driveline with the aim of accurately predicting the lowest possible weight of the half shafts for a driveline configuration while considering complex requirements. First the parametric equations defined in the SysML model that estimate the impact torque are solved. Next a response surface model is created that takes the impact torque as an input and outputs the optimal weight of the half shaft axle. In order to do this, a CAE model of the half shaft axle is developed as an automated workflow. It uses a parametrized CAD model to define the geometry which is then evaluated for maximum stress and deflection with an FEA solver. The performance of all possible axle geometries is sampled using a large DOE and approximated using an RSM. An optimization workflow is then created that uses this RSM to find the optimal geometry for a specified torque load. This workflow is evaluated for a range of torque values and is in turn approximated using an RSM to create a single executable component that provides optimal half shaft axle weight as a function of applied torque. This axle performance component is connected to the SysML model together with a catalog of available CV Joints to enable the study of tradeoffs between weight and cost for the complete half shaft. The SysML model also integrates a requirement that checks if a chosen axle geometry can fit into a housing defined in CAD. Finally, the paper demonstrates optimization of the half shaft under complex constraints using the complete model. ? 2021 Phoenix Integration.",Commerce; Geometry; Torque; Automated workflow; Complex constraints; Executable components; Input and outputs; Maximum stress; Optimal geometry; Parametric equation; Response surface modeling; Computer aided design,I.

Madni A.M.; Erwin D.; Madni C.C.,Digital Twin-enabled MBSE Testbed for Prototyping and Evaluating Aerospace Systems: Lessons Learned,2021,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,17,"With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control. ? 2021 IEEE.",Digital twin; System of systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adaptive coordination; Aerospace systems; Dynamic scenarios; Emergency response; Model integration; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Perimeter security; Search and rescue; Testbeds,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,1,,,,

Flooding events caused by ARs can create millions of dollars in damages. Identifying probable ARs and early warning of potential flooding events can provide state and local agencies the time to prepare for such events. The Bay Area Advanced Quantitative Precipitation Information (AQPI) system links users with varied meteorological data ranging from weather radar observations, short term forecasts (Nowcast), 12-hour forecasts, and coastal inundation modeling data. The range of data types presents an opportunity for proactive responses by the users; however, it also presents the challenge of ensuring the correct data is available to the appropriate user. Through Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Behavioral Analysis, the AQPI team analyzes the appropriate requirements for each of the different types of AQPI users. MBSE behavioral analysis leads to the development of a system that services the broad user community's needs while giving each user group a specific interface tailored for them. This engineering approach also allows for the separation of the processing and weather model execution from the user interface. This separation allows for development and advancements in processing without being tied to the user interfaces.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Behavioral research; Floods; Meteorological radar; Meteorology; Systems engineering; Behavioral analysis; Behavioral response; Inundation modeling; Meteorological data; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Short-term forecasts; Specific interface; User interfaces,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,
Sherry L.; Baldo J.; Berlin B.,Design of flight guidance and control systems using explainable AI,2021,"Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference, ICNS",0,"Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of Flight Guidance and Control Systems (FG&CS) using Machine Learning (ML) from large archives of operational flight data. As the scope of the missions of drones/Small Unmanned Airborne Systems (sUAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles increase (e.g. operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) over people), the need for proof-of-compliance for safety regulations is required. Approaches to meet the regulatory airworthiness requirements for software assurance, such as those embodied in DO-178, require coverage of paths through the code. This ※path coverage requirement§ can be achieved by a sub-class of ML, known as Explainable ML (X-ML) that enables the derivation of formal models, such as Situation-Goal-Behavior Models (SGBM), from the ML FG&CS. This paper describes the results of a case-study of the development of an X-ML FG&CS that highlights the limits of an X-ML only approach and the need for a Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) analysis and design to complete the design to meet safety performance standards. The case study identified, specifically, the presence of five design error archetypes. These design error archetypes can be eliminated (i.e. addressed) by analysis of the SGBM using Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) Tools as described in this paper. The implications and limitations of this approach for developing airworthy FG&CS are discussed. ? 2021 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Safety engineering; Systems engineering; Airborne systems; Behavior model; Guidance and control system; Model-based system engineerings; Operational flights; Safety performance; Safety regulations; Software assurance; Flight control systems,"L.

The system architectures, organizations, research and development processes using MBSE to design complex systems can be seen as a System of Systems (SoS), which has high complexity and hard to manage. The concept of digital thread is proposed to integrate all the models and data in the SoS. However, lack of cognition ability makes it hard to connect the models and data with human, processes and things in the SoS, which reduces the efficiency of complex system development. In this paper, a new concept named Cognitive Thread is first proposed as digital thread with augmented semantic capabilities for identifying the information of the SoS. Then a cognitive thread construction approach based on Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specification and knowledge graphs is proposed to support decision-making and management in the SoS.

Liu J.; Liu J.; Zhuang C.; Liu Z.; Miao T.,Construction method of shop-floor digital twin based on MBSE,2021,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,55,"Digital twin (DT) technology is essential for achieving the fusion of virtual-real cyber-physical systems. Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method ※MagicGrid,§ and the ※V model§ of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the ※V model,§ including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of ※man, machine, material, and method§ and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness. ? 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Embedded systems; Floors; Integrated control; Modeling languages; Real time systems; Synchronization; Systems engineering; Large complex systems; Model-based systems engineering; Synchronization systems; System modeling languages; System verifications; Theoretical research; Transient simulation; Visualization system; Digital twin,"C.

It reviews the concept of ME and integrates ME with a MBSE framework for the development of the DT. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study where the UAS is deployed for a Last Mile Delivery (LMD) mission in a military context where adversaries are present, and a route optimization module recommends an optimal route to the user based on a variety of inputs including potential damage or destruction of the UAS by adversary action. The optimization module is based on Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) which analyzes predefined criteria which the user assessed would enable the successful conduct of the UAS mission. The article demonstrates that the methodology can execute a ME analysis for route selection to support a user＊s decision-making process.

The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible frame-work to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several compo-nents, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior.

Yang L.; Cormican K.; Yu M.,Ontology Learning for Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge,2021,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,24,"Extant systems engineering standards are so fragmented that the conceptualization of a cohesive body of knowledge is not easy. The discrepancies between different standards lead to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, making communication between stakeholders increasingly difficult. Moreover, these standards remain document centric, whereas systems engineering is transforming from paper-based to a model-based discipline. This requires the use of advanced information exchange schema and digital artifacts to enhance interoperability. Ontologies have been advocated as a mechanism to address these problems, as they can support the model-based transition and formalize the domain knowledge. However, manually creating ontologies is a time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious process. Little has been known about how to automate the development and little work has been conducted for building systems engineering ontologies. Therefore, in this article, we propose an ontology learning methodology to extract a systems engineering ontology from the extant standards. This methodology employs natural language processing techniques to carry out the lexical and morphological analyses on the standard documents. From the learning process, important terminologies, synonyms, concepts, and relations constructing the systems engineering body of knowledge are automatically recognized and classified. A formal and sophisticated system engineering ontology is achieved, which can be used to harmonize the extant standards, unify the languages, and improve the interoperability of the model-based systems engineering approach.  ? 2005-2012 IEEE.",Engineering education; Interoperability; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Systems engineering; Advanced informations; Engineering ontologies; Engineering standards; Model-based systems engineering; Morphological analysis; NAtural language processing; Sophisticated system; Systems engineering body of knowledge; Learning systems,"L.

Preidel M.; Stark R.,Semdaserv: A systematic approach for semantic data specification of ai-based smart service systems,2021,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),5,"To develop smart services to successfully operate as a component of smart service systems (SSS), they need qualitatively and quantitatively sufficient data. This is especially true when using statistical methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI): training data quality directly determines the quality of resulting AI models. However, AI model quality is only known when AI training can take place. Additionally, the creation of not yet available data sources (e.g., sensors) takes time. Therefore, systematic specification is needed alongside SSS development. Today, there is a lack of systematic support for specifying data relevant to smart services. This gap can be closed by realizing the systematic approach SemDaServ presented in this article. The research approach is based on Blessing＊s Design Research Methodology (literature study, derivation of key factors, success criteria, solution functions, solution development, applicability evaluation). SemDaServ provides a three-step process and five accompanying artifacts. Using domain knowledge for data specification is critical and creates additional challenges. Therefore, the SemDaServ approach systematically captures and semantically formalizes domain knowledge in SysML-based models for information and data. The applicability evaluation in expert interviews and expert workshops has confirmed the suitability of SemDaServ for data specification in the context of SSS development. SemDaServ thus offers a systematic approach to specify the data requirements of smart services early on to aid development to continuous integration and continuous delivery scenarios. ? 2021 by the authors.

Jesus G.T.; Junior M.F.C.,The roles of modeling and simulation in assessing spacecraft Integration Readiness Levels,2021,"15th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, SysCon 2021 - Proceedings",2,"Introducing new technologies in Complex Products and Systems (CoPS) requires in-depth knowledge of technology and the system integration process. Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) is a systematic evidence-based process that assesses technology maturity based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). System Readiness Assessment (SRA) is the process of conducting integrated assessments of a developing system to assess technology maturation and provide a systemic understanding of the development life-cycle. The Integration Readiness Levels (IRL) scale complements TRL in representing integration between technological elements in a system, and both scales are used in SRA to calculate system readiness metrics. SRA is expected to be an emerging systems engineering best practice and has evolved over the last decade. However, SRA does not explicitly guide whether simulation could comply with IRL dedicated to interface verification and validation. Modeling and simulation (MS) play many roles in systems engineering. Digital and MS technologies advancement, as Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and digital twins, may contribute to reducing space missions costs and schedule, along with trends in systems and technology reuse. This research identified the possible roles of modeling and simulation in assessing spacecraft Integration Readiness Levels. Results showed MS possible roles for each IRL and whether the roles were essential or support to achieve IRL. Also, a link between system life cycle processes and these results contributes to the SRA research stream. A case study with the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) program was used to validate part of the proposed theory, in line with other cases extracted from the literature. This paper contributes to the SRA research stream with these theoretical and practical results, by suggesting future studies that could improve SRA practice and consequently support the decision-making on technology introduction in CoPS.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Cobalt compounds; Decision making; Digital twin; Life cycle; Phosphorus compounds; Space flight; Systems engineering; China-brazil earth resources satellites; Engineering best practice; Integrated assessment; Model-based system engineerings; Technology introductions; Technology maturation; Technology readiness levels; Verification-and-validation; Cost engineering,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,

Essentially, the global quest for sustainable development across every sector is on the rise; hence, the need for a sustainable method of extracting energy cheaply with less wastage and pollution is on the priority list. This research, integrates and formulates different ideologies, factors and variables that have been adopted in previous research studies to create an efficient system. Some of the aforementioned researches includes pumped hydro gravity storage system, Compressed air gravity storage system, suspended weight in abandoned mine shaft, dynamic modelling of gravity energy storage coupled with a PV energy plant and deep ocean gravity energy storage. As an alternative and a modification to these systems, this research is proposing a Combined solar and gravity energy storage system. The design synthesis and computational modelling of the proposed system model were investigated using a constant height and but varying mass. Efficiencies reaching up to 62% was achieved using the chosen design experimental parameters adopted in this work. However, this efficiency can be tremendously improved upon if the design parameters are modified putting certain key factors which are highlighted in the limitation aspect of this research into consideration. Also, it was observed that for a test load of 50 ℅ 103 mA running for 10 h (3600 s), the proposed system will only need to provide a torque of 3.27Nm and a height range of 66.1 ℅ 104 m when a mass of 10 kg is lifted to give out power of 48 kwh. Since gravity storage requires intermittent actions and structured motions, mathematical models were used to analyse the system performance characteristics amongst other important parameters using tools like MATLAB Simscape modelling toolbox, Microsoft excel and Sysml Model software. ? 2021, Crown.",Abandoned mines; Compressed air; Electric energy storage; MATLAB; Mine shafts; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Computational modelling; Design parameters; Energy storage systems; Experimental parameters; Modeling softwares; Performance characteristics; Renewable energy source; Residential application; Pumped storage power plants,"O.K.

Riesener M.; Doelle C.; Perau S.; Lossie P.; Schuh G.,Methodology for iterative system modeling in agile product development,2021,Procedia CIRP,14,"Nowadays, manufacturing companies are challenged by dynamic market environments caused by increasing globalization, digitization and climate change. Therefore, the ability to act with speed, flexibility and efficiency in product development becomes inevitable for success. Moreover, various stakeholder requirements have to be considered and time to market has to be reduced. The development of complex mechatronic systems also requires an interdisciplinary cooperation of various engineering domains, i.e. mechanics, electrical engineering and computer science. Agile product development addresses these challenges with its focus on the iterative development of functional system increments. As a result, it enables to reduce time to market and improves handling of changing customer requirements. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach with its centralized system model serves as a single source of truth and data repository. Thereby, it enhances efficiency and transparency along the product development process. The integration of MBSE into agile product development offers numerous opportunities, such as virtual prototypes and the build-up of a product's digital twin. As the design of a complete system model at the beginning of a development process requires high temporary resources, an iterative approach should be applied to incrementally build the system model along the product development process. In this paper a methodology for the iterative system modeling in agile product development is presented. In each agile sprint, design parameters based on a development question are elaborated. The information that supports answering the development questions is provided by the system model. Since the system model itself can only provide but not process information it is necessary to select the best toolset to process the necessary information.

Madni A.M.; Erwin D.; Purohit S.; Madni C.C.,Digital-twin enabled experimentation testbed for mbse,2021,AIAA Scitech 2021 Forum,1,"As Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) continues to advance in terms of system life cycle coverage, modeling languages, methods, and tools, there is a growing need for an overarching framework to organize MBSE artifacts and facilitate their rapid retrieval and use by MBSE researchers. Also, researchers need a simulation environment that supports exploration, experimentation with different modeling constructs and algorithms, and performance data collection over a broad range of conditions and with different assumptions. To address these requirements, this paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE research testbed for modeling, experimentation, and verification and validation, and exploration of system behaviors over a wide range of operational scenarios and operating conditions. The testbed is intended to help researchers analyze data to uncover patterns and trends, reuse models and components as applicable, and serve as a repository for scenarios, system models, case studies, and lessons learned. Two different operational scenarios from different domains are used to convey the capabilities of the testbed.

McNeil D.; Aitken C.; Mercury C.; Mohapatra S.; Jeffrey H.; Oi D.,From complex to complicated: development of a Model Based Systems Engineering and cyber security approach for a quantum key distribution nanosatellite.,2021,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",0,"Current global security systems are built on the premise that mathematical complexity and limitations of processing power are sufficient to protect data. With the emergence of quantum computing these assumptions are now being challenged. Space based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of encryption key delivery offering significant benefits over ground-based counterparts in terms of range and coverage. Additionally, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers increases in efficiency through cloud avoidance. For an AI enabled nanosatellite for QKD, design engineers must trade the often-conflicting requirements of space, cybersecurity, AI and quantum to progress the design from the complex to the merely complicated. The Responsive Operations for Key Services (ROKS) mission aims to provide QKD services which augment larger scale QKD efforts. The onboarding of AI to detect and avoid cloud has a significant impact on the concept of operations, moving to significant levels of autonomy. In systems engineering terms, added to the design burden of implementing an emerging technology such as QKD, the established principles of operation are also being challenged. Additionally, as nanosatellites have rarely been deployed as nodes in a secure network to date, the project requires the synthesising of different security standards and approaches into a coherent framework. For the programme significant consideration is given to project lifecycle. In the initial phases agile principles are employed, allowing for experimentation in design. With increasing knowledge of the problem space, there is a reduction in the uncertainty in design elements, leading to a transition from an agile based lifecycle to the waterfall-based methods more suitable for Flight Model implementation. Underpinning the project is a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. Enterprise Architect was selected as the MBSE tool of choice during blue sky design stages, allowing a smooth transition from capability level considerations to systems and subsystems design. The Zachman framework offers a consistent, but potentially over flexible, approach to model development. MBSE offers a clear methodology for integrating the model with external simulation tools to provide on ground verification of platform behaviours and porting design effort to support new mission concepts. The application of flexibility in lifecycle management, sound security principles and a model-based approach to technical development has proven to be a highly effective approach in increasing our understanding of complex systems allowing for complicated, but mature, designs to be defined. ? 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

The problem of how to acquire the knowledge carried by the system model and reuse the system model is urgently required to be solved. Therefore, a cross-products system model graph construction method supporting system model reuse is proposed. System model graph is constructed by defining the SysML metamodel ontology and the construction strategy is given. The entity alignment based on the relationship set and the rule-based reasoning is applied to achieve the fusion of multiple subgraphs, and the semantic extended retrieval of design requirements is realized based on this graph. Finally, the case studies of the Automatic Climate Control Integrated System of car and satellite design verify the effectiveness and practicability of the method, supporting system model reuse. In conclusion, the paper indicates that it is feasible to express the system model with knowledge graph and the constructed system model knowledge graph can well support the retrieval and reuse of cross- products system models.  ? 2013 IEEE.",Climate models; Knowledge engineering; Semantics; Systems engineering; Unified Modeling Language; Cross product; Knowledge graphs; Model reuse; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling; Object oriented modelling; SysML; System model reuse; System models; Systems engineering and theories; Knowledge graph,"J.

The OECS generates commands to ※plant§ actuators based on emerging situations in the operational environment. An OECS is certified as ※airworthy§ when the functional design is considered complete such that an appropriate behavior for all operational situations is specified. Although Artificially Intelligent (AI) OECS can be developed more rapidly with Machine Learning (ML) than with traditional manual OECS development, analysis found that AI OECS exhibit gaps in the design of the functional behavior. Specifically, the AI OECS designs are either missing operational situations, or missing appropriate mapping of operational situations to behaviors. These two design issues are well-known issues in manual engineering and have been addressed with ※model-checking§ in Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) tools. This paper describes a unique OECS development process that joins Explainable Machine Learning (X-ML) for OECS development with Model-based System Engineering models and tools. A preliminary OECS functional model is generated by X-ML in a format that is compatible with MBSE functional behavior models. The MBSE model-checking tools are then used to identify and design the missing functional behavior. The MBSE functional behavior model can be used to generate code and for proof of compliance for certification. This collaborative process can significantly shorten the OECS development time while maintaining high standards of design quality. ? 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Virtual simulations can have a substantial impact because role-playing facilitates active learning, permits the acceptance of new concepts, and generates increased interest, enthusiasm, and motivation. Research over the last 50 years has shown that reasoning about context is an essential aspect of human cognition, permeating language, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This necessary process is developed over a lifetime through experiential learning. In this research, we utilize systems engineering to capture guidelines from psychologists and concepts of technological leadership. These guidelines are converted into requirements and technical specifications (using SysML) of virtual simulation environments (built using OpenSim). These virtual simulation environments are then used to test subjects and see the potential changes in leadership skills. The virtual simulation includes a meditation module.

Anderegg A.H.A.; Mulcare S.P.,Assuring Human and Artificial Intelligence are Appropriately Informed in Aviation Systems,2021,AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings,2,"Developments driving adoption of new entrants to aviation, namely artificial intelligence (AI) and more ubiquitous information, will redefine roles as they create teams of humans and machines to manage facets of aviation operations. The safety outcome depends on how well the human-machine team is designed and controlled to evolve. This occurs via distributed decision making, where decision makers need shared understanding of how their decisions affect others, and the possible implication of others' actions on their remaining options. The information available to each decision maker must provide the context and coordination they need to create this shared understanding. The safety controls and mitigations must account for what a human on the loop or over the loop know about what the AI is thinking and what they add to command a better safety outcome. The machine must know what the human is thinking and the outcome they are trying to achieve. And then the machines must understand each other, just as the people must also understand one another's options and actions. The key to adopting these new entrants is shared understanding of information in terms of inputs, context, assumptions, decision points, options, and desired outcomes. This paper examines recent efforts to capture information needs in model-based system engineering tools. It highlights extensions proposed by the authors to address the human-machine team needs. The extensions include a construct for complex, distributed decision-making environment like aviation where coordination is essential to prevent decisions from undermining the strategy of the mitigation layers.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Coordination reactions; Predictive analytics; Safety engineering; Autonomous system; Certification; Decision makers; Distributed decision making; Distributed-decision makings; Human-machine; Human-machine teaming; Run-time assurance; Runtimes; Shared understanding; Decision making,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,1
Van Acker B.; Mertens J.; De Meulenaere P.; Denil J.,Validity frame supported digital twin design of complex cyber-physical systems,2021,Simulation Series,0,"Digital twins, that is, system models that track a specific system instance, enable various new possibilities in the domains of industry 4.0 and Cyber-Physical Systems. At their core, they consist of models and large amounts of data. Those models often abstract away or linearize parts of the system. Thus, to correctly interpret the output data of the digital twin, one must reason about the model's valid operation region. This paper introduces an approach based on the Validity Frames concept to support this validity reasoning and ensure valid model use within the digital twins context. A Validity Frame encapsulates additional validity data of a model, and is especially suited for checking model validity, hence the name. Additionally, the approach also enables a partly automated commissioning of the digital twin.

Lutfi M.; Valerdi R.,Framework for Integration of Virtual Reality into Model Based Systems Engineering Approach,2021,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,1,"Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an ever-growing philosophy in order to develop, manage and sustain the increasingly complex systems. In present practice, MBSE is overwhelmingly replacing document centric approach by model centric approach. Most widely used MBSE language is the ※Systems Modeling Language (SysML)§, which follows Object Oriented Systems Engineering Methodology (OOSEM). Most MBSE approaches including SysML leverages static viewpoints and limited simulation capability to create and analyze a system model. Now, SysML as a MBSE language is matured enough to incorporate widespread dynamic modeling and simulation into MBSE practices. Virtual Reality can play an important role on creating dynamic MBSE approaches. This research work has proposed a framework for incorporating Virtual Reality (VR) tools into MBSE practices in order to develop ※true§ model centric approach. The framework consists of a System Model built using SysML, VR tool (Unity 3D), scripting languages and System data sources. SysML diagrams can represent Requirements, Use Cases, Concept of Operations, System Architecture, System Behaviors, Parametric analysis of a System of Interest (SOI) in the System Model. The framework will facilitate dynamic simulation of the system being described in the System model. VR tools can visualize the use case scenarios and simulate the behaviors of the system described in the Model. This framework will also facilitate automatic requirements verification through interactive VR environment. The system model is fed into the VR environment for the analysis of the proposed system architecture, use cases and requirements. Based on the VR environment simulation results, modifications are incorporated into the System Model. The integration of VR tool with the SysML System Model (which acts as a source of truth) is performed with the aid of scripting languages. Moreover, a System Data source will support both the model and VR environment simulation. Finally, the research paper has mentioned few implications to implement the framework and proposed possible solutions. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",\,"M.

A simple flexible robotic arm is considered as a benchmark problem for the evaluation of various techniques used in the phases of modelling, analysis, control system design, validation, and implementation. The flexible nature of the mechanical structure introduces inherently oscillatory dynamics in the target bandwidth range, which complicates all the above-mentioned design steps. This paper demonstrates the process of deriving a complex nonlinear model of the flexible arm setup. An initial idea about the plant dynamics is acquired from analytical modelling using the Euler每Bernoulli beam theory. A more thorough understanding is subsequently acquired from finite element analysis. Linearisation and order reduction are the next steps necessary for the derivation of a simplified control-relevant model. A time-dependent variable parameter of load mass position is considered and a robust controller is subsequently designed in order to fulfil certain performance criteria for all the admissible plant configurations. This is performed using a recent H-infinity loop shaping method for fixed structure controller design.

S.; Vock S.,AN INTEGRATIVE AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH FOR A HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN OF AI-BASED WORK SYSTEMS,2021,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",0,"Psychological and ethical criteria are to date not systematically covered in the system design process. We suggest to extend existing model-based system engineering approaches by new elements that are capable to capture these criteria and, in particular, allow for an implementation of psychological risk analysis and ethical evaluation of work systems already in the design phase. The need for a systematic integration of not only safety but also ethical and psychological criteria in the system design is strengthened by the growing complexity of work systems and the increasing use of artificial intelligence-based algorithms, which have the potential to replace distinctive human capabilities and are associated with a shift of responsibility from humans to machines. We identify essentially two factors impeding the development of an innovative integrative system design approach. First, at present, there is no legally predefined iterative process including an open feedback loop between the operator and the system designer that enables continuous risk assessment. Second, available methods do not provide a framework to integrate ethical and psychological criteria. We propose four steps for the development of an integrative system design approach: (1) an in-depth investigation of current methods suitable for holistic system design processes, (2) the development of a transdisciplinary terminology, (3) the development of a procedure which allows to identify ethical criteria meeting both individual and societal requirements and (4) testing of the developed approach in a digital system model by using a suitable use case.

Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is widely used for UAV development, particularly for the layout design of UAV radar cabin. In this paper, a semantic modeling approach based on KARMA language is proposed to create the system model of the radar cabin layout based on an MBSE approach for formalizing Requirement, Function, Logical and Physical structure (RFLP). Moreover, the KARMA models for UAV radar cabin layout modeling are transformed to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in MATLAB toolkit for radar cabin layout optimization by code generation. Based on the layout information generated from the KARMA models, the optimized layout solution is generated by the MATLAB toolkit. From the case study, we find the KARMA language enables to formalize the radar cabin design based on nine diagrams of SysML specification. And optimizations can be executed automatically after getting data generated from KARMA models. Thereby, the proposed semantic modeling approach improves design efficiency and quality during radar cabin design. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Industrial management; Radar; Semantics; Systems engineering; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Integrated modeling; Layout optimization; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Physical structures; Semantic model approaches; SysML specification; UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle); Modeling languages,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

Though MBSE models provide a completely structural formalisms about system development for system developers, such large of domain specific knowledge represented by models cannot be captured as what the developers expect. This leads to a big challenge when MBSE can be widely used for complex system development. In this paper, a knowledge management approach is proposed to support an intelligent question answering scenario when implementing MBSE in system lifecycle. We make use of the GOPPRR approach to support MBSE formalisms which are transformed to knowledge graph models. Then such models provide cues for intelligent question answers through reasoning. In the case study, we make use of an auto-braking system scenario to develop MBSE models and to implement the intelligent question answering.

Rasor R.; G?llner D.; Bernijazov R.; Kaiser L.; Dumitrescu R.,Towards collaborative life cycle specification of digital twins in manufacturing value chains,2021,Procedia CIRP,18,"A digital twin is a digital representation of an unique product or product service system that is sufficient to meet the requirements of a set of use cases. Following this definition, the implementation of a digital twin must be derived from concrete use cases along the life cycle of a product. However, the involvement of a variety of different stakeholders and frequent changes of ownership in the value chain complicate the identification of use cases as well as the specification of the digital twin and its governance. This leads to a need for a systematic approach that enables various partners to implement the digital twins needed for their specific use cases. This paper presents a specification technique that combines aspects from Model-Based Systems Engineering with Product Lifecycle Management to support a collaborative front-end planning and specification of digital twins. It integrates the different views of various digital twin stakeholders (product manager, systems engineer, developer, data scientist etc.) in a collaborative model across the value chain. As part of the systematic approach, a digital twin specification grid that structures guidelines for the aspects of a digital twin (e.g. the data sources) across the product life cycle is provided. The presented approach also supports the derivation of a digital twin by integrating different use cases.

This paper presents a SysML-based approach to design and develop a stereo vision-based perception system in an urban platooning scenario. It detects objects, lane markers, and free space in front of the follower vehicle using deep neural networks and computes the lead vehicle's relative pose and velocity. The relative pose is estimated using a geometric model-based pose estimation algorithm. The relative velocity is estimated from the change in pose within a known time. The lead vehicle's relative pose and velocity control the follower vehicle to follow the lead vehicle autonomously. Also, it displays the lead vehicle's pose and velocity information in a meaningful way on the in-vehicle display of the follower vehicle. The proposed system uses a custom-built automotive-grade stereo camera as input and runs on an automotive-grade embedded platform. It is tested on a simulation and prototype cooperative automated vehicle research platform. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed system operates in real-time and is suitable for cooperative automated vehicles. ? 2021 IEEE.",Automation; Deep neural networks; Modeling languages; Object detection; Simulation platform; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision; Velocity; Automated vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Cooperative automated vehicle; Lead vehicles; Pose-estimation; Relative velocity; Stereo vision system; System modeling language; System models; Velocity estimation; Autonomous vehicles,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,

Peterson M.; Summers J.D.,Recommended methods supporting adoption of the agile philosophy for hardware development,2021,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2,"The objective of this research is to understand the historical evolution of software development, identify desirable characteristics of methods supporting agile for hardware, and recommend potential methods enabling agile development of hardware products. As technology and markets change, product development increasingly operates in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. While originally applied to software development, organizations are starting to see opportunity in adapting the agile philosophy for hardware development. A comparison of philosophies is made between waterfall, spiral, and agile development. The historical evolutions of software development, after agile, including Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment (CICD), Development and Operations (DevOps), and Development Security and Operations (DevSecOps) is presented. Benefits and challenges in the application of agile methods for hardware are presented. Benefits include improvements in flexibility in response to change and soft factors such as team communication, transparency and commitment. However, many challenges still remain. These are grouped into theme areas including lack of product flexibility, difficulty in separating deliverables, challenges with breaking down tasks within a sprint, changes needed in culture and mindset, difficulty scaling beyond pilot programs, team distribution, and development of an integrated approach across the product lifecycle. Potential methods to aid in the adoption of agile for hardware are discussed using the phases of the hardware development lifecycle as a framework. Recommended methods include the adaptation of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for problem definition, the use of generative methods for design, the application of Virtual Reality (VR) for prototyping, leveraging additive manufacturing for production, and favoring software defined systems to help in operations. By reducing both the duration and person-hours, these methods enable higher iteration rates for hardware products needed for an agile philosophy. The paper concludes with a discussion on future research efforts supporting the enabling agile development of hardware.

Madni A.M.; Purohit S.,"Augmenting MBSE with Digital Twin Technology: Implementation, Analysis, Preliminary Results, and Findings",2021,"Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",7,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) requires more significant investment than traditional systems engineering in the early system life cycle phases. Program management justifies this additional investment by arguing that such investments can be expected to produce continuous gains across later phases of the systems life cycle resulting from early detection of defects, risk reduction, improved communication, superior supply chain integration, product line definition, and enhanced traceability. Since systems continue to evolve over their life cycle, system models need to be updated continually to reflect the system's current state and thereby sustain value. However, in today's systems engineering organizations, the current practice is to reallocate modeling resources to other projects once initial modeling on a particular project is completed. This practice results in a resource shortfall that impedes the ability to continuously update system models through the later phases of the system life cycle. This paper presents how digital twin technology can be exploited within MBSE to ensure continuous model updates throughout the system life cycle. This paper also presents preliminary results from prototyping and experiments conducted with a digital twin that is continuously updated with data from the physical system operating in the real world. Finally, this paper shows how operational analysis and system modeling can be significantly enhanced by leveraging digital twin technology within MBSE.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Investments; Life cycle; Supply chains; Continuous gains; Detection of defects; Implementation analysis; Model-based system engineerings; Program management; Risks reduction; System life cycle; System models; Technology implementation; Traditional systems; Systems engineering,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

However, the existing theories and methods of product design are lack research on the integration of modeling concepts, domain-specific knowledge, and decision-making. For this reason, this paper proposes a C-D-K theory which is supported by a semantic modeling approach. Firstly, KARMA modeling language, which is a semantics modeling approach, is used to support the formalization of concept space (C) and decision space (D), in which space C is expanded based on the RFLP design framework, and space D is based on PEI-X decision workflow to realize decision problem modeling. Then based on the Open service lifecycle collaboration (OSLC) specification, domain-specific knowledge is represented based on the unified expression of resources in the knowledge space (K), which is used to integrate knowledge to semantics models constructed by KARMA language. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed semantic modeling approach are verified by the case of an unmanned detection vehicle design. From the result, we find the semantics modeling approach enables to integrate semantic models and knowledge based on the C-D-K theory. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Industrial management; Knowledge based systems; Life cycle; Product design; Semantics; Concept decisions; Decision problems; Design frameworks; Domain-specific knowledge; Knowledge based; Knowledge spaces; Modeling concepts; Semantic model approaches; Modeling languages,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

The coexistence of combustion engine and e-mobility platforms, but also design modifications on products during production phase, require constant and agile product adaptation in automotive structural components. These changes to the structural car body design have different effects on production planning. However, in some cases they have a considerable influence on the equipment design, e.g., the choice of jig, fixture, and joining technology and the number of robots used. This means that investment decisions for the procurement of new equipment or even entire production systems are also determined. In particular, late introduced new requirements or engineering changes in the product development process (PDP) have a massive impact on the quality of planning and compliance with established premises at the beginning of the PDP. Measures for the holistic consideration of engineering changes and their influences require both a product-side and a production-side review of influences. In this review paper, existing approaches for the product and production-side handling of requirements and engineering changes are analyzed by a systematic literature review. Existing data-based methods are analyzed with regard to their applicability on engineering change management (ECM) in body shop. Based on this, enabling methods are assessed concerning their suitability for the transfer to a holistic, adaptive, and data-based ECM system for the PDP of automotive car bodies. ?

Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software.

Opasjumruskit K.; Schindler S.; Peters D.,Automatic Data Sheet Information Extraction for Supporting Model-Based Systems Engineering,2021,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2,"To describe modeling objects in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools, physical properties of these objects are often provided only in data sheets, which are not truly machine-readable. Previously, we proposed a product data hub to exchange spacecraft product information between manufacturers and various MBSE tools. However, issues with heterogeneous structures and semantics of information, such as differences in data format and vocabularies, persist. Using ontologies to maintain product descriptions can mitigate the heterogeneity problem by providing semantic descriptions and supporting different vocabularies for a single concept. To automatically and semantically obtain information from documents that contain tables, lists, and text, we developed an ontology-based information extraction tool. We present how to use the Data Sheets Annotation Tool (DSAT) for, either manually or automatically, extracting information from data sheets, and populating a database with the obtained data. Particularly, we emphasize on the usage of DSAT as a user interface for improving ontologies, which, in turn, are used for a (better) information extraction from the data sheets. Although DSAT is initially created for supporting collaborative systems engineering, it is not limited to the domain of spacecraft design. It can also be applied to other domains, where information needs to be extracted from a multitude of heterogeneous sources. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Information retrieval; Semantic Web; Semantics; Systems engineering; User interfaces; Annotation tool; Data sheets; Engineering tools; Information integrated; Model-based system engineerings; Ontology for information sharing; Ontology's; Semantic technologies; Semantic technology for information-integrated collaboration; Web based cooperation tool; Ontology,"K.

"Morkevicius A., Aleksandraviciene A., Krisciuniene G.",From UAF to SysML: Transitioning from System of Systems to Systems Architecture,2021,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The fourth industrial evolution, Internet of Things, and large-scale machine-to-machine interactions are driving digital transformation in the industry. Model-based Systems engineering (MBSE), as a new paradigm of capturing and analyzing knowledge about the system, is one of the core factors to drive this transformation. MBSE practices are more and more widely applied to system-of-systems (including enterprise and mission) engineering, which becomes a crucial part of the successful digital transformation. The core challenge today is how digital continuity can be maintained by connecting system models to system-of-systems models, especially when multiple parties are involved in their creation and exploration. This paper studies Systems Modeling Language (SysML) as the standard language to model systems, and Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) as the framework and Unified Architecture Framework Profile (UAFP) as the language to model system of systems and proposes an approach for transitioning from one to another in an integrated modeling environment.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,
"Riesener M., D?lle C., Becker A., Gorbatcheva S., Rebentisch E., Schuh G.",Application of natural language processing for systematic requirement management in model-based systems engineering,2021,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Today, manufacturing companies are confronted with an enormous number of product requirements, which increasingly demand an interaction of the different engineering disciplines mechanics, electric/electronic (E/E) and software. At the same time, companies must realize a shorter time to market, lower costs and higher quality. As a result, development methods are required, which support the fast, flexible and structured transfer of numerous requirements into products despite this increased complexity in processes and products. In this context, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) takes advantage of the increasing digitalization of products and development processes. It provides structures and processes for the efficient processing of requirements by fostering the collaboration between different engineering disciplines and enabling early validation of the product. In this context, it is often challenging that requirements are not structured, but rather unstructured and heterogeneous. For the processing within MBSE, text-based requirements today usually still have to be prepared with high manual effort. This paper presents a methodology that supports the transformation of unstructured and heterogeneous text-based requirements using Natural Language Processing in order to prepare them for further processing within MBSE.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,

The solution is based on a synthesis of relevant knowledge about international concepts of digital transformation of production systems. The design model is an information object model. The architectural concept is based on that the state of values of properties material assets, petroleum products, is affected by the state of the values of the parameters of the role equipment. On the one hand, the process control contour boundary is a cost center, on the other hand - is a profit center. The presented model is a digital twin of the hydrotreating process. The architecture solution can be replicated for other technological processes (or their segments) of production, which have continuous production in their life cycle. The architecture is consistent with the architecture of IoT, provides the ability to use synthesized machine learning technologies, takes into account landscape interoperability, provides business logic SAP ERP.

Document-based system engineering is difficult to meet the current requirements for development, and model-based system engineering is becoming the best choice. Although the models have become an important artifact of the current complex product development, and do help to improve the efficiency, and the information transmission efficiency is not high due to the complex process. Thus, a system model configuration method based on RFBS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the system model graph is constructed based on SysML meta-model ontology.

Pappalardo C.M.; Lombardi N.; Guida D.,A model-based system engineering approach for the virtual prototyping of an electric vehicle of class l7,2020,Engineering Letters,23,"This study is aimed at creating an accurate mathematical model concerning an electric vehicle of class L7. This category includes quadricycles having a mass less than 400 kg, batteries excluded, and power below 15 kW. To this end, an electromechanical model with three degrees of freedom is developed in the Matlab-Simulink virtual environment employing the Simscape library. In the mechanical model developed in this investigation, the main degrees of freedom considered are the forward advancement, the vertical displacement, and the angular pitch. Furthermore, two additional degrees of freedom are also included in the dynamical model in order to take into account the suspension displacements as well as the dynamic effects induced by the stiffness and damping characteristics of the tires. The behavior of the contact force generated by the interaction of the tires with the road profile is described by using the Pacejka Magic Formula. On the other hand, the propulsion unit is modeled considering three different configurations: the first scheme is composed of a central electric engine having a fixed gearbox and a mechanical differential; the second design solution is similar to the previous one but is equipped with a two-speed gearbox; finally, the third configuration consists of two separate electric engines. In all the design configurations mentioned before, the vehicle can be controlled by providing the driver inputs, by controlling the cruising speed, or by ensuring that the vehicle follows a specific driving cycle. By means of a comparative analysis performed between the three different design configurations, the proposed virtual model allows for identifying which design solution is the most appropriate, thereby reducing the time required in the design phases and also simplifying the entire process development. In conclusion, it can be stated that the virtual prototype developed in this work is able to satisfactorily predict the dynamical behavior and the energy consumption of the L7 class vehicle of interest. ? 2020, International Association of Engineers.

Increasingly complex in-vehicle systems are making traditional safety analysis artifacts more difficult for reviewers to understand. One of the requirements for improvement is to provide more understandable explanations of failure behaviors. The AIAG/VDA FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) handbook, published in 2019, introduced the FMEA-MSR (Supplemental FMEA for Monitoring and System Response) to explicitly describe the behavior of failures called the Hybrid Failure Chain (e.g., chain of failure mode, failure cause, monitoring, system response, and failure effects). For more precise explanations of the safety analysis artifacts, we propose a method to integrate and visualize failure behaviors into architectural design diagrams using SysML. Based on FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and FMEA results, along with SysML diagrams (e.g., internal block diagrams), the proposed method imports represent FMEA and FTA data graphically as Hybrid Failure Chains with a system model to improve information cohesion in the safety analysis artifact. We found that the proposed method facilitates the discovery or recognition of flaws and omissions in the fault model. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Embedded systems; Fault tree analysis; Monitoring; Security systems; System of systems; Block diagrams; Failure behaviors; Failure effects; Failure mode and effect analysis; In-vehicle systems; Safety analysis; System modeling; System response; Safety engineering,"N.

In the last decade, we have seen several emerging technologies that will potentially have a great impact in complex systems. These new technologies are expected to cause a disruptive impact not only in the products but also in to the tools used across the whole product life cycle. For this reason, is imperative to perform a critical review of the current systems engineering tooling ecosystem. This assessment should also map the open research problems that could prevent the complete integration of the new technologies into the systems engineering framework. This paper proposes a new architecture for a system engineering environment to operate in large scale projects. The objective of this research is twofold: it will first identify the capabilities for the next generation platform, and secondly, it will evaluate how artificial intelligence applications can be integrated in compliance with DO-330.

Traditionally, the design and construction process requirements are expressed through verbal qualitative evaluations instead of using numerical and structured data. Information modeling and management methods can hardly manage requirements expressed by means of qualitative and unstructured expressions. This paper aims to define the state of the art on Natural Language Processing applications for the numerical translation of basic design requirements in the AECO sector. The major advantages of this research would be the optimization and automation of numerical definition and validation of requirements in a structured data form. Structured data can, in fact, be easily managed in a BIM approach. NLP supporting information modeling methods allows the application of requirements engineering and management techniques to handle construction processes from a data-driven perspective. An investigation of the setting of a decision support system, based on NLP, for the definition and validation of requirements in the early stages of the construction process, is also provided as a potential further development. ? 2020 ISEC Press.",\,,ISEC Press,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,1,,,,
Hillebrand M.; Lakhani M.; Dumitrescu R.,A design methodology for deep reinforcement learning in autonomous systems,2020,Procedia Manufacturing,7,"Autonomous systems such as mobile robots will play an important role in fields like industrial production, transportation or in hostile environments such as space. One of the most fundamental problem in autonomous mobile robotics is autonomous navigation. It is imperative for a mobile robot to learn to navigate in complex environments such as roads or buildings. The most popular approach to this problem is to utilize different algorithms for mapping the environment, self-localization in the map, planning a trajectory to the given goal and executing this trajectory. However, there are some drawbacks of these approaches. We often make assumptions about the environment such as no dynamic or transparent objects. Moreover, there is considerable overhead, they do not learn from failures and operation scenarios. This prompts us to search for alternative approaches for autonomous navigation, such as deep reinforcement learning. However, the application of deep reinforcement learning to a particular task involves a series of non-trivial design decisions. Previous work have failed to address the need for a design methodology for deep reinforcement learning systems. In this paper, we propose design methodology and discuss relevant design decisions for deep reinforcement learning in autonomous systems. We apply the methodology to the problem of autonomous navigation. ? 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",\,"M.

Iwamaru Y.; Matsuura Y.; Miyazawa K.,PrPSc with seeding activity extensively overlaps with proteinase-resistant PrPSc rather than infectious PrPSc,2020,Pathogens,3,"The disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) has the ability to seed the conformational conversion of normal prion proteins into the amyloid fibril form. This prion seeding activity can be measured using an in vitro amplification assay termed real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). There is a strong correlation between RT-QuIC positivity and prion infection; however, the relationship between seeding activity and infectivity remains elusive. In this study, we used endpoint dilution RT-QuIC on the brain homogenates from wild-type mice with mouse-adopted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mBSE) at defined intervals during the incubation period and evaluated the temporal relationship among prion seeding dose, levels of proteinase-resistant PrPSc (PrPres), and infectious titer. We found that the infectious titer reached a plateau by 100 days postinfection, whereas seeding dose and PrPres levels were continuously elevated. Our calculation showed that the doubling time (dt) for seeding dose from 40 to 100 days postinoculation was closer to the dt for PrPres levels than to the dt for prion titer. Although an uncoupling of seeding doses and PrPres levels was observed at end-stage disease in this model, our findings suggest that there is substantial but not complete overlap between PrPSc with seeding activity and PrPres rather than infectious PrPSc. ? 2020 by the authors.

Guariniello C.; Marsh T.B.; Porter R.; Crumbly C.; Delaurentis D.A.,Artificial Intelligence Agents to Support Data Mining for SoS Modeling of Space Systems Design,2020,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,9,"The complex and multidisciplinary nature of space systems and mission architectures is especially evident in early stage of design and architecting, where systems stakeholders have to keep into account all the aspects of a project, including alternatives, cost, risk, and schedule and evaluate various potentially conflicting metrics with a high level of uncertainty. Though aerospace engineering is a relatively young discipline, stakeholders in the field can rely on a vast body of knowledge and good practices for space systems design and architecting of space missions. These guidelines have been identified and refined over the years. However, the increase in size and complexity of applications in the aerospace discipline highlighted some gaps in this approach: first, the amount of available information is now very large and originates from multiple sources, often with diverse representations, and useful data for trade space analysis or analysis of all potential alternatives can be easily overlooked; second, the variety and complexity of the systems involved and of the different domains to be kept into account can generate unexpected interactions that cannot be easily identified; third, continuous advancements in the field of aerospace resulted in the development of new approaches and methodologies, for which a common knowledge database is not existing yet, thus requiring substantial effort upfront. To address these gaps and support both decision making in early stage of space systems design and increased automation in extraction of necessary data to feed working groups and analytical methodologies, we propose the training and use of Artificial Intelligence agents. These agents can be trained to recognize not only information coming from standardized representations, for example Model Based Systems Engineering diagrams, but also descriptions of systems and functionalities in plain English. This capability allows each agent to quantify the relevance of publications and documents to the query for which it is trained. At the same time, each agent can recognize potentially useful information in documents which are only loosely connected to the systems or functionalities on which the agent has been trained, and which would possibly be overlooked in a traditional literature review. The search for pertinent sources can be further refined using keywords, that let the user specify more details about the systems or functionality of interest, based on the intended use of the data. In this work we illustrate the use of Artificial Intelligent agents to sort space habitat subsystems into NASA Technology Roadmaps categories and to identify relevant sources of data for these subsystems. We demonstrate how the agents can support the retrieval of complex information required to feed existing System-of-Systems analytic tools and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps. ? 2020 IEEE.",Aerospace engineering; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Intelligent agents; NASA; Query processing; Search engines; Space applications; System of systems; Systems analysis; Analytical methodology; Artificial intelligence agent; Artificial intelligent; Complex information; Different domains; Literature reviews; Mission architectures; Model-based systems engineering; Data mining,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Ballard M.; Peak R.; Cimtalay S.; Mavris D.,Bidirectional Text-to-Model Element Requirement Transformation,2020,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,6,"Elicitation, representation, and analysis of requirements are important tasks performed early in the systems engineering process. This remains true with the adoption of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodologies. Existing SysML-based methodologies often choose between (i) using external requirements documents and/or databases as the authoritative source for requirements truth versus (ii) generating requirements directly, as elements in the system model. In either case, there is often need for the systems engineer to manually develop a model-based requirements representation, as this faculty is not automatic in the commonly-used SysML feature set. Additionally, once the system model has been completed, systems engineers typically must prepare traditional 'shall-statement' requirements for external review purposes, as not all stakeholders can be expected to be trained in system model interpretation. This paper details a novel effort to address both problems, by automatically transforming text-based requirements (TBR) into SysML model-based requirement (MBR) representations, and vice versa. The text-to-model based transformation direction uses requirement templates and natural language processing techniques, expanding on work from the field of requirements engineering. This paper also presents an aerospace-domain case study application of the developed tool. In the case study, a selected set of requirements were analyzed, and a system model was constructed. Then, the intermediate output system model was updated with additional elements, to represent the progression of the project's systems engineering process. The modified system model was then analyzed, constructing text-based requirements from the structure. The resulting text-based requirements were compared to the initial set of input requirements to assess consistency in both directions of analysis. The methodology developed in this paper improves the systems engineering process by saving the systems engineer time constructing potentially repetitive model elements, and by enabling model-based requirement analyses to methodologies previously only capable of processing text-based requirements. Further, the methodology eases the responsibility of the systems engineer to maintain a copy of the model-based requirements in text-based format. ? 2020 IEEE.",Engineers; Natural language processing systems; Systems engineering; Aerospace domain; Model based transformations; Model-based requirements; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); NAtural language processing; Requirements document; System modeling; Systems engineering process; Engineering education,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Barosan I.; Basmenj A.A.; Chouhan S.G.R.; Manrique D.,Development of a virtual simulation environment and a digital twin of an autonomous driving truck for a distribution center,2020,Communications in Computer and Information Science,15,"This paper presents the development of a Virtual Simulation Environment (VSE) and a Digital Twin (DT) of an autonomously driving truck for a distribution center. While autonomous driving on public roads still faces various technical and legal challenges, within a distribution center, which is a confined area, some of these restrictions do not apply. Therefore, distribution centers can be the first environment where the autonomous driving of trucks is possible. A distribution center is a closed environment with no, or minimal generic traffic, where the trucks have relatively low speeds, short stopping distance and layout precisely known. Dedicated sensors locate the trucks. This paper addresses the mentioned aspects of driving in the distribution centers describing the necessary steps taken for the design, implementation, and testing of a VSE for a distribution center, and a DT of an autonomously driving truck. The development of the VSE is based on the integration of a SysML modeling tool 每 IBM Rhapsody, MATLAB Simulink, and Unity Game Engine using a Model-Based System Engineering approach. The paper also presents the test and the validation of a driving scenario used in a distribution center, using the TruckLab setup of the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands.

Van Mierlo S.; Oakes B.J.; Van Acker B.; Eslampanah R.; Denil J.; Vangheluwe H.,Exploring Validity Frames in Practice,2020,Communications in Computer and Information Science,16,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides workflows, methods, techniques and tools for optimal simulation-based design and realization of complex Software-Intensive, Cyber-Physical Systems. One of the key benefits of this approach is that the behavior of the realized system can be reasoned about and predicted in-silico, before any prototype has been developed. Design models are increasingly used after the system has been realized as well. For example, a (design) digital twin can be used for runtime monitoring to detect and diagnose discrepancies between the simulated and realized system. Inconsistencies may arise, however, because models were used at design time that are not valid within the operating context of the realized system. It is often left to the domain expert to ensure that the models used are valid with respect to their realized counterpart. Due to system complexity and automated Design-Space Exploration (DSE), it is increasingly difficult for a human to reason about model validity. We propose validity frames as an explicit model of the contexts in which a model is a valid representation of a system to rule out invalid designs at design time. We explain the essential and conceptual, yet practical, structure of validity frames and a process for building them using an electrical resistor in the optimal design of a high-pass filter as a running example. We indicate how validity frames can be used in a DSE process, as well as for runtime monitoring. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Computer software; Digital twin; Embedded systems; Structural design; Automated design; Complex software; Explicit modeling; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Runtime Monitoring; Simulation-based designs; System complexity; Techniques and tools; High pass filters,"S.

The Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology (EVDT) Modeling Framework will integrate four models into one tool that can be adapted to specific applications; the four models address the following: earth science models of the Environment: Human Vulnerability and Societal Impact; Human Behavior and Decision-Making; and Technology Design for earth observation systems including satellites, airborne platforms and in-situ sensors The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of earth observation and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence fishing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Environment Model builds upon work by biospheric scientists Fatoyinbo and Lagomasino to use earth observation data, cloud computing, and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the ESPA?O research group at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To build the Human Vulnerability and Societal Impact Model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economist Suhyun Jung to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. To create the Human Decision Making Model, we have partnered with the Pereira Passos Institute (the data science office of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. The Technology Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1975. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive decision support tool that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes? This case study is demonstrative of the viability of a similar approach for ecosystems around the world. Copyright ? 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Pickering N.; Duke M.; Lim S.H.,A time constrained System of Systems discovery process and canvas. A case study in agriculture technology focusing on an automated Asparagus Harvester.,2020,"SOSE 2020 - IEEE 15th International Conference of System of Systems Engineering, Proceedings",0,"Agriculture is facing a period of unprecedented change resulting from the requirement to feed c. 10 billion mouths by 2050, while operating in a challenging business environment with increasing sustainability and consumer expectations. To meet these challenges many are looking to industry 4.0 technology as a solution, specifically the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in-field robotics. Although there have been successful prototypes from a functional perspective and promising start-ups, the complex nature of the agriculture system of systems creates a significant risk of mass adoption failure. The main risk stems from the majority of the hundreds of products being designed in isolation using closed hardware and software systems that are all aiming to serve the one farmer or grower. The current silo'd technology adoption approach is heading towards problems with usability, availability, viability, interoperability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new time constrained System of Systems (SoS) discovery process and supporting SoS Canvas, developed with the objective of increasing the adoption of SoS principles with non-technical stakeholders. The time constrained SoS discovery process consists of raising awareness, capturing data, modelling the SoS, modelling the System of Interest (SoI) and providing recommendations, often based on common challenges and opportunities from the SoS Canvas. The outcome of this initial case study prototyping the process, is a set of SysML diagrams demonstrating how the constituent systems currently contribute to emergent properties and recommendations to improve both the SoI and the SoS. Future research will focus on interoperability within agricultural technology (Agritech) and the potential for a SoS level digital twin, providing the capability to manage and optimise emergent properties for the betterment of all. ? 2020 IEEE.",Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Digital twin; Harvesters; Interoperability; Sustainable development; Agricultural technologies; Agriculture systems; Agriculture technology; Business environments; Consumer expectations; Hardware and software; Technical stakeholders; Time-constrained systems; System of systems,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,
Bricher D.; M邦ller A.,A supervised machine learning approach for intelligent process automation in container logistics,2020,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,13,"Process control in manufacturing industries usually lacks flexibility and adaptability. The process planning is traditionally pursued within the production scheduling and then remains unchanged until a major overhaul is necessary. Consequently, no process knowledge acquired by the machine operators is used to adapt, and thus improve, the process control. In this paper, a fully automated process control solution for container logistics is proposed, which is based on deep neural networks and has been trained from process steering decisions made by employees. Further, a fully automated framework for the labeling of container images is introduced, making use of inherent properties of the logistic process. This allows to automatically generate data sets without the need for manual labeling by an operator.  ? 2020 by ASME.",Automation; Containers; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Production control; Supervised learning; Container logistics; Intelligent process automation; Machine operators; Manufacturing industries; Process knowledge; Production Scheduling; Steering decisions; Supervised machine learning; Process control,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),Article,Scopus,,,,,1,,,

On the other hand, the need for formalization and verification in the design of complex systems is now more evident than ever. To the end of easing integration of formal methods in industrial model based system engineering workflows, UTRC Ireland has developed a tool aiming to render requirements formalization as effortless as possible to the industrial engineer. The developed approach is an end-to-end solution, starting with natural language requirements as input and going all the way down to auto-generated monitors in MATLAB / Simulink. We employ natural language processing and machine learning techniques for (semi-)automatic pattern extraction from requirements, which drastically reduces the required formalization workload for both legacy and new requirements.

Xia X.; Liu W.; Zhang Z.; Wang L.,Partial disassembly line balancing problem analysis based on sequence-dependent stochastic mixed-flow,2020,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,5,"Given the characteristics of decommissioning product diversity, wear difference, and structural complexity, we analyzed the disassembly line balance problems of minimum disassembly workstation, station load balancing, priority disassembly of high-demand parts and the lowest cost of invalid operations, and further considered the influence of random factors on actual disassembly operations. The purpose of this paper is to establish a model of sequence-dependent stochastic mixed-flowed partial disassembly line balancing problem and propose an adaptive hybrid particle swarm genetic algorithm to solve the model. The algorithm replaces the fixed value genetic operator with an adaptive crossover and mutation operator to improve the global optimization ability. The introduction of adaptive weighted particles leads to improved local optimization ability of the algorithm so that the algorithm has strong global and regional optimization ability to improve algorithm accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by solving the classic disassembly line balancing problem with different scales and comparing it with the solution results of underlying genetic and particle swarm optimization algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to the mixed-flow disassembly engineering project of a 25-task reducer. The results indicate that the proposed model is superior to the control group in terms of minimal disassembly workstation, station load balancing, invalid operation cost, and overall performance of the disassembly line, which verifies the validity of the model.

Nanbo X.,Realization of MATLAB Model Callaborative Simulation in Hopsan Environment based on Hopsan Framework,2020,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,0,"The design and simulation process of complex system is accelerated because of the general application of model-based system engineering method in industry. But new challenges arise along with it, such as joint simulation of multi-physical-domain models. Only by considering the coupling relationship among the physical domains, especially the Cyber-physical systems (CPS), can the simulation result be more consistent with the actual system so that can provide guidance for product design and manufacturing. Heterogeneous model is the key to solve the problem of multi-physical-domain coupling simulation [1]. Using tools integration[2] and semantic integration[3] are two mainly ways. Although the literature points out that using tools integration is challenging, the advantages of open source software integration at the source level make it possible for Hopsan software to realize joint simulation of heterogeneous models. This paper describes how to inherit a new one from the component class of Hopsan to realize the functions of second encapsulation of MATLAB model in the current Hopsan environment, the block diagram representation in the simulation schematic diagram, model scheduling in the simulation process, data input, output processing and data transmission, etc. ?

Digital Twins have been successfully used in many application domains, and thus, are considered as an important aspect of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, their development, maintenance, and evolution still face major challenges, in particular: (i) the management of heterogeneous models from different disciplines, (ii) the bi-directional synchronization of digital twins and the actual systems, and (iii) the support for collaborative development throughout the complete life-cycle. In the last decades, the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) community has investigated these challenges in the context of software systems. Now the question arises, which results may be applicable for digital twin engineering as well. In this paper, we identify various MDE techniques and technologies which may contribute to tackle the three mentioned digital twin challenges as well as outline a set of open MDE research challenges that need to be addressed in order to move towards a digital twin engineering discipline. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital twin; Life cycle; Real time systems; Collaborative development; Engineering disciplines; Future challenges; Heterogeneous models; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Model-driven Engineering; Research challenges; Software systems; Information management,"R.

Space agencies, such as: CNES, DLR, ESA, ESOC, INPE, JAXA and NASA, stimulate initiatives and the development of projects aimed at efficiency and cost reduction of missions. The classes of satellites and spacecraft have requirements that, classically, determine the design and development of the mission; these requirements currently cover definitions, such as communication protocols, uplink and downlink rates, onboard processing and remote reconfiguration of service and payload modules, and direct new modes (models) of controlling and operations that are requested from the ground segment. Among the activities for designing systemic solutions to attend a space mission, the ground segment has a significant number of questions to be answered in order to meet cost and operability requirements and reach a successful mission. From the perspective of the ground segment, it is essential to demonstrate the innovation of concepts that are required of systems due to the increase in volume and kind of data (Big Data), and their processes, for example, machine learning and artificial intelligence; and also of the utilization of communication protocols, and onboard processing. These concepts include the development of projects and the operation of missions and must be implemented according to the guidelines of the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in the area of systems engineering, as well as meeting the recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), such as: Management Services for Data Transfer, Space Link Extension (SLE) Protocol Services for Cross Support and Interoperability.

Lutfi M.; Valerdi R.,Virtual Reality in Model Based Systems Engineering: A Review Paper,2020,Communications in Computer and Information Science,1,"Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) thrived in the recent decades in order to overcome the increasing complexity within systems. MBSE envisioned replacing document centric systems engineering by model centric systems engineering. MBSE can handle systems complexity efficiently by representing each entity in the model only once and generating different viewpoints. Most commonly used MBSE language is the ※Systems Modeling Language (SysML)§. Virtual Reality can play a bigger role on creating truly model centric systems engineering approaches. The core application of MBSE approach implies utilization of a single system model, which will act as ※source of truth§ to all embedded system analyzing tools. Thus, the system model can communicate back and forth with Virtual Reality Environment to analyze the system performance. Systems engineer can conduct interactive immersive simulation of a scenario described in the system model and return the results obtained from the Virtual Reality Environment to the system model. Requirements analysis can be performed more efficiently by ensuring participation of the customers early in the product lifecycle utilizing the VR environment. A customer can walk into VR environment and see how the system design would look like and interact with it. Based on the interaction results, the systems engineer can modify the product/service specifications and design. This paper reviewed the works been done to incorporate virtual reality environment with SysML. The paper also proposed a framework on how VR environment can be implemented with SysML to perform true MBSE practice. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Human computer interaction; Life cycle; Modeling languages; Product design; Systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Product-life-cycle; Requirements analysis; System modeling; Systems complexity; Systems modeling languages; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual reality,"M.

Salehi V.; Taha J.; Wang S.,Application of munich agile concept for mbse by means of automated valet parking functions and the 3D environment-data,2020,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2,"In today's complex world of development of functions for automating Driving Systems (ADS), methods, tools, systems and new approaches are necessary for a seamless application. Furthermore, it is important to apply new technics of simulation and visualization (Digital Twin) for the new ADS functions. To prototype and to test these functions in a physical manner is not only a costly and complex effort but also encounters legal and bureaucratic obstacles. The importance of simulation is very high. For that reason, this paper and corresponding research project will develop a consistent traceable System Engineering approach of autonomous driving functions and its environment based on Munich Agile Concept for Model-Based-Systems-Engineering (MBSE). MBSE is based on three important core pillar which is 1) Methods/Processes, 2) Language and 3) Systems. The purpose of the new developed Munich Agile Concept Approach is to handle the complexity over the entire ADS feature development from the system requirement definition process up to the test and validation of the system. The Munich Agile Concept contains six different levels which are System Requirement-, System Functional-, System Architecture-, System Validation-, System Test and the System-Usage-Level. For defining the first three-level, a graphical language called System Modelling Language (SysML) has been applied.

Lebeaupin B.; Rauzy A.,Toward a better integration of requirements and model-based specifications,2020,Systems Engineering,4,"As of today, most specifications of technical systems still rely on requirements written in natural language. However, this approach is known to be problem-prone, due to the inherent ambiguity of natural languages. On the other hand, fully formal or model-based approaches seem to be out of reach in many practical cases, especially in early design phases of systems. In this article, we study how to combine in a pragmatic way natural language requirements with models. We propose to keep both formats and to link pieces of text in requirements with elements of models. In other words, corpuses of requirements are managed as hypertexts with links to models. For this approach to be fully efficient, the text of requirements is not free, but relies on controlled natural language techniques leading to a partial structuring of the text. We show that this makes it possible to design (semi)automatic verifications on requirements and models, which would be impossible with unconstrained natural language. We illustrate here our approach on a small illustrative example and we report results obtained on a full size industrial?application. ? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Hypertext systems; Specifications; Systems engineering; Automatic verification; Controlled natural language; Early design phasis; Model based approach; Model-based specifications; Natural language requirements; Natural languages; Technical systems; Natural language processing systems,"B.

Sjarov M.; Ki?kalt D.; Lechler T.; Selmaier A.; Franke J.,"Towards ""design for Interoperability"" in the context of Systems Engineering",2020,Procedia CIRP,8,"In product development, early decisions made within the requirements specification and design phase have significant impact on overall functionality, quality and lifecycle cost of the product. In Systems Engineering, these oftentimes iterative design phases are steered by underlying development models, providing processes, guidelines and best practices. One family of guidelines are the ""Design for X"" (DfX) tools or principles. In the development of mechatronic systems e.g. production systems, traditionally the mechanical, electric and software domain are to be distinguished. Over time, driven by trends of digitalization, communication and interconnection of systems, the product innovation and thus the required development effort has been shifting from the mechanical domain towards the software domain. The question of system interoperability thereby is of a fundamental nature. This is especially relevant within the current paradigms of Industry 4.0 and the Digital Twin. To reflect the growing importance of interoperability (i.e. the ability of systems to purposefully interchange interpretable information) as a requirement for the product within the design phase of technical systems, this paper introduces ""Design for Interoperability"" (DfIOp) as a new DfX principle. First, this is motivated by the ever-growing importance of information technology for current and future products. Then, the main contribution of the paper is the combination of the state of the art in the research domains of DfX, interoperability, Systems Engineering and Industry 4.0. Consequently, DfIOp will be presented, including a systematization model as well as a first method for its implementation. Further contemplation on DfIOp shows, that it enables derivative principles such as ""Design for Data Analytics"" and ""Design for Digital Twin"". In future research, the underlying models as well as methods of DfIOp are to be further detailed and integrated into the research context. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V..

We define an ※intelligent technique§ as a technique that explores data (from digital artifacts or domain experts) for knowledge discovery, reasoning, learning, planning, natural language processing, perception or supporting decision-making. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to synthesize and analyze the state of the art of the field of applying intelligent techniques to Agile Software Development (ASD). Furthermore, we assess its maturity and identify adoption risks. METHOD: Using a systematic literature review, we identified 104 primary studies, resulting in 93 unique studies. RESULTS: We identified that there is a positive trend in the number of studies applying intelligent techniques to ASD. Also, we determined that reasoning under uncertainty (mainly, Bayesian network), search-based solutions, and machine learning are the most popular intelligent techniques in the context of ASD. In terms of purposes, the most popular ones are effort estimation, requirements prioritization, resource allocation, requirements selection, and requirements management. Furthermore, we discovered that the primary goal of applying intelligent techniques is to support decision making. As a consequence, the adoption risks in terms of the safety of the current solutions are low. Finally, we highlight the trend of using explainable intelligent techniques. CONCLUSION: Overall, although the topic area is up-and-coming, for many areas of application, it is still in its infancy. So, this means that there is a need for more empirical studies, and there are a plethora of new opportunities for researchers. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Decision making; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Object oriented programming; Risk assessment; Agile software development; Intelligent software; NAtural language processing; Reasoning under uncertainty; Requirements management; Requirements prioritization; Search-based software engineering; Systematic literature review; Software design,"M.

Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  ? 2020 ACM.",Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Students; Artificial intelligence techniques; Classroom settings; Intelligent solutions; Learning objectives; Model based software engineering; NAtural language processing; Practice of modelling; Problem description; Learning systems,"R.

Bickford J.; Van Bossuyt D.L.; Beery P.; Pollman A.,Operationalizing digital twins through model-based systems engineering methods,2020,Systems Engineering,42,"In recent years there has been increased demand for readiness and availability metrics across many industries and especially in national defense to enable data-driven decision making at all levels of planning, maintenance, and operations, and in leveraging integrated models that inform stakeholders of current operational system health and performance metrics. The digital twin (DT) has been identified as a promising approach for deploying these models to fielded systems although several challenges exist in wide adoption and implementation. Two challenges examined in this article are that the nature of DT development is a system-specific endeavor, and the development is usually an additional effort that begins after initial system fielding. A fundamental challenge with DT development, which sets it apart from traditional models, is the DT itself is treated as a separate system, and therefore the physical asset/DT construct becomes a system-of-systems problem. This article explores how objectives in DT development align with those of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and how the MBSE process can answer questions necessary to define the DT. The key benefits to the approach are leveraging work already being performed during system synthesis and DT development is pushed earlier in a system's lifecycle. This article contributes to the definition and development processes for DTs by proposing a DT development model and path, a method for scoping and defining requirements for a DT, and an approach to integrate DT and system development.

Eren K.K.; Ozbey C.; Eken B.; Tosun A.,Customer requests matter: Early stage software effort estimation using k-grams,2020,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,1,"Estimating the software development effort associated with a customer request, immediately after the request has been made, is quite challenging for project managers. Studies on software effort estimation often utilize expert knowledge to build statistical or machine learning models, although it is subjective and human-dependent. Rich text, natural language based descriptions provided by the customers are mostly not incorporated into the models during estimation. The aim of this study is to propose an early stage software effort estimation model that can predict the effort of the related problem immediately after a customer request or bug fix problem is appeared. Our model utilizes the textual descriptions of customer requests collected in the requirement management tool, and other features stored with the customer requests. Our results show that the use of textual data helps to make better predictions for an effort estimation system. Besides the effect of textual data, we asked whether there is a significant difference between the performance of an effort estimation system that can be used for all customers (Unified Model) and Customer Specific Models which is trained using only the related customer's requests. The Pred(25), Standard Accuracy (SA) and Gibbs' A were used during the evaluation. The Unified Model for early stage effort estimation achieves 43% pred(25) and 51% SA values. Customer Specific Models, on the other hand, depending on the customer, obtain 39%-58% Pred(25), and 35%-58% SA values. The results show that there is no significant advantage between the Unified Model and Customer Specific Models, and which model to use should be determined according to the customer. ? 2020 ACM.",Object oriented programming; Software design; Effort Estimation; Expert knowledge; Machine learning models; Natural languages; Requirement management tools; Software development effort; Software effort estimation; Textual description; Sales,,Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

Significant efforts, costs and timely requirements are involved to conduct the required analyses. In this paper, we describe a novel integrated model-based approach of systems engineering and dependability analyses. The behavior of system components is specified by UML state machines determining intended/correct and undesired/faulty behavior. Based on this information, our approach automatically generates different dependability analyses in the form of fault trees. Hence, alternative system layouts can easily be evaluated.

Geridonmez B.P.,A new regression-based approach to estimate the shape parameter of MQ-RBFs in a free convection problem,2020,Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,3,"In this study, a novel procedure is proposed to determine the shape parameter of multiquadric (MQ) radial basis function (RBF) utilizing multivariate adaptive regression splines (Mars) in a free convection problem. Input data (truth data) of Mars is prepared by applying MQ-RBF pseudospectral (PS) method to a free convection problem in a cavity with differentially heated vertical walls. Shape parameter determination in this step is also proposed. The input data obtained by the numerical method and by the proposed way to determine shape parameter is used in the package earth of R project, and a model function is built to estimate the shape parameter. Then, instead of using the proposed search inside the numerical method, the model function determines the shape parameter at any truth data. Results are also compared with a benchmark study, and good agreement is observed in the same free convection problem. The model function built is also tested against the results of the original method.

Given the ad-hoc, disparate, and informal nature of natural language documents, these views become quickly inconsistent. Rigor in engineering work is also lost in the transition from model-based engineering design and analysis to engineering documents. Once the documents are delivered, the engineering portion of the work is disconnected. In the Open Model Based Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE), Cross-References (aka transclusions) synthesize relevant engineering information where model elements are not simply hyperlinked, but de-referenced in place in a document, upgrading a document-based process with model-based engineering technology. Those Cross-References are nowadays partially created manually, putting a burden on the engineer who is authoring the document. This paper presents an approach which can assist the engineer by providing machine-generated suggestions for Cross-References using language processing, graph analysis, and clustering technologies on model data managed by the OpenMBEE infrastructure.  ? 2020 ACM.",Clustering technologies; Design and analysis; Engineering document; Engineering information; Engineering practices; Language processing; Model-based engineering; Model-based systems engineering; Systems engineering,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,1

DevOps is generally applied in software development, however in the design of CPS, which follows a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach, it is not.

Its success and the technology evolution allow targeting more complex and critical applications such as the management of critical infrastructures and cooperative service robotics, which requires real time operation and a higher level of intelligence in the monitoring-control command for decision-making. Furthermore, these applications type need to be fully validated in advance considering that bugs discovered during real operation could cause significant damages. In order to avoid these drawbacks, IoT developers and system integrators need advanced tools and methodologies. This paper presents a methodology and a set of tools, defined and developed in the context of the BRAIN-IoT European Union (EU) project. The overall framework includes both Open semantic models to enforce interoperable operations and exchange of data and control features; and Model-based development tools to implement Digital Twin solutions to facilitate the prototyping and integration of interoperable and reliable IoT system solutions. After describing the solution developed, this paper also presents concrete use cases based on the two critical systems mentioned above, leveraging the application scenarios used to validate the concepts developed and results obtained by the BRAIN-IoT project.

Kulcs芍r G.; Jeroschewski S.E.; Olotu K.; Kristan J.,Bringing clouds down to earth: Modeling arrowhead deployments via Eclipse Vorto,2020,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,1,"The design and development of interconnected industrial production facilities, which integrate aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) or, more specifically, the Industrial IoT (IIoT), often deals with complex scenarios involving dynamic System of Systems (SoS), resulting in immense development and deployment efforts. The Arrowhead community aims at delivering mechanisms and technologies to cope with such complex scenarios. In particular, the concept of local clouds constitutes a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework for IIoT. Here, a central challenge is the conceptual modeling of such use-cases. SysML is widely established as a standardized modeling language and framework for large-scale systems engineering and, thus, for Arrowhead local cloud designs. However, SysML and its Arrowhead profile lack a canonical way to support actual platform modeling and device involvement in heavily distributed IIoT scenarios. The Eclipse Vorto project is ideal for filling this gap: it provides a modeling language for IoT devices, a set of modeling tools, and already existing reusable templates of device models. In this paper, we propose an approach to integrating Eclipse Vorto models into Arrowhead SysML models. We illustrate the concept with a realistic yet comprehensible industrial scenario and also present a prototype to emphasize the benefits of our novel integration platform.

Rovetto R.J.; Kelso T.S.; O'Neil D.A.,"Orbital debris ontology, terminology, and knowledge modeling",2020,Journal of Space Safety Engineering,3,"The looming threat orbital debris poses to assets in orbit demands solutions. As the orbital population grows, so does the risk of collision, as well as the volume of associated data. It is, however, an opportunity for interdisciplinary innovation and cooperation. This paper focuses on the data management and knowledge modeling aspect of developing solutions for a sustainable and safe orbital space environment. An in-progress work to develop an orbital debris reference ontology [Rovetto, 2015] is summarized in order to discuss knowledge modeling for orbital debris. The formal analysis of this effort can contribute to standards development, as well as terminological and policy challenges. Leveraging the growing volumes of orbital debris and space situational awareness (SSA) data will create a more complete picture of the orbital space environment. Part of the solution will be: consistent and correct data interpretation, sharing orbital debris and SSA data in one form or another, terminology development & harmonization, and knowledge or domain modeling. To facilitate this, [Rovetto, 2015] proposed ontology development for the orbital debris and broader space domain. This paper summarizes concepts from that paper, and subsequently developed concepts [2-9]. See also https://purl.org/space-ontology and https://purl.org/space-ontology/odo. Ontology engineering is an interdisciplinary area of research related to knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence, model-based systems engineering, semantic technologies and the so-called semantic web. An ontology is effectively a computable and semantically rich terminology that presents a knowledge or domain model for a topic area. Expressions of knowledge, beliefs, or assertions are stored using formally defined terms. This knowledge base is reasoned over to yield answers to database queries, among other things. Ontologies have been developed in knowledge-based projects across various disciplines, and used for such things as search engines, chatbots, and enterprise knowledge graphs. Ontologies aim to support: interoperability, automated reasoning, data sharing and integration, data search and retrieval, and communicating the meaning of data. The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO) [1], and related ontologies [Rovetto & Kelso 2016] [Rovetto 2016, 2017], were proposed to help achieve this. ODO, for instance, is intended as a domain ontology that can be used across federated databases, offering an explicitly specified set of concepts describing the orbital debris domain. Its meaning-rich taxonomy will provide a sharable semantics for orbital debris data to, in part, consistently communicate the meaning of data to both humans and machines, and tag data elements in space object catalogs to help afford automated reasoning tasks, decision support, knowledge discovery, and information integration. ODO and the SSA ontology (SSAO) [2] is part of the overall Orbital Space Ontology concept, which is conceived as a unifying domain reference ontology. It aims to provide a knowledge representation structure of orbital space, a common semantic model, and develop a sharable terminology. Collectively this will provide common meaning for datasets, a high-level taxonomy or classification for orbital space objects, and a means to characterize space objects. Ongoing efforts have included using visualizations, R, JSON-LD, and contemporary semantic technologies. Potential applications include web-based platforms, web apps, visualizations, modeling and simulations. Community input and participation may yield a more widely understood domain model as well as facilitate terminological standards. For example, conceptual, terminological, and ontological analysis can make helpful contributions to such efforts as the Space Debris Mitigation Requirements by developing more precise, consistent and coherent terms and definitions. Other projects can also use ODO (and its related ontologies) as a common knowledge model, metadata set, taxonomy or vocabulary.

Starting from research and engineering activities, up to production and delivery, the need of maintaining the trace of dependence, changes, and possible updates regarding the final product is a crucial aspect for success. Particularly, conceptual and preliminary design activities are affected by a high level of uncertainty and a certain degree of project instability, usually caused by the need to explore alternative solutions and variants. Different tasks are performed concerning the identification of system requirements, functional and physical behavior using model-based design (MBD), and model-based systems engineering, which, generally, are subjected to extensive trade studies aimed at identifying the best solution. In this context, this paper presents how model-based digital twin and threads concepts will likely change the way in which the MBD process is managed, overcoming the issues associated with federated IT infrastructures and with tools integration. Notably, lifecycle and nonlifecycle related interoperability aspects are described, with particular focus on the exploitation of standards for lifecycle collaboration and heterogeneous simulation.

K邦sel K.,Model-Based System Engineering for Life Cycle Development of Digital Twins of Real Estate,2020,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The evolving complexity of today's Smart City challenges requires agile systems that can deliver quick, real-time insight into as-built assets to all stakeholders. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) or digital twins hold promise to enable interconnected, data analysis of as-built assets throughout the lifecycle of the asset. In the real estate industry, a vision is emerging to develop Digital Twins of Real Estate (DTREs) ? being dynamic, virtual data models of real-world assets that aggregate all information on the asset and provide continuous feedback via a single, 3D dashboard. Key technologies in use include Internet of Things (IOT) technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) processes and Machine Learning (ML). A DTRE enables stakeholders to better understand, predict and optimize performance of the real-world asset throughout its lifecycle. In practice, most as-built assets are not in digital, data model format and owners and managers are faced with distributed information sets and analytical tools. ISO 19650 (Part 1 and 2) guides the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in Building Information Modelling (BIM) and management processes to deliver data models during the design and build phase. There is no formal process to guide DTRE development and limited, published case studies to demonstrate the business case. This paper presents a first Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) framework for the AEC industry to guide development of DTREs. The framework was compiled by synthesizing the author's experience, the traditional System Engineering (SE) vee diagram, ISO 19650 and reverse engineering available case studies.

In this paper, we present opportunities for Systems Engineering (SE) to evolve towards a data -driven and evidence -based discipline, thereby making better systems and engineering decisions. We discuss how systems engineers can apply data-driven characteristics through systems engineering processes and programs. The classical Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches are presented here as powerful tools to collect, generate, and analyze data on systems under development. In addition, the ?Digital Twin? concept is presented here in the context of system design. We highlight the challenges for systems engineering to become an evidence-based discipline. Moreover, we empha-size research and development in systems engineering processes using statistical techniques in the design and analysis of systems testing, and Model-Based Systems Engineering (SE) as a source for evidence-based engineering decisions. The success of data driven SE in organizations depends on the information and data analytics infrastructure in these organizations. An information quality frame-work is proposed for evaluating organizational information infrastructure. In addition, it is proposed to assess the data analytics maturity level in organizations. The level of data analytics is the basis for planning implementation programs of data-driven and evidence-based systems engineering.

Wilhelm M.E.; Le A.V.; Stuber M.D.,Global optimization of stiff dynamical systems,2019,AIChE Journal,12,We present a deterministic global optimization method for nonlinear programming formulations constrained by stiff systems of ordinary differential equation (ODE) initial value problems (IVPs). The examples arise from dynamic optimization problems exhibiting both fast and slow transient phenomena commonly encountered in model-based systems engineering applications. The proposed approach utilizes unconditionally stable implicit integration methods to reformulate the ODE-constrained problem into a nonconvex nonlinear program (NLP) with implicit functions embedded. This problem is then solved to global optimality in finite time using a spatial branch-and-bound framework utilizing convex/concave relaxations of implicit functions constructed by a method which fully exploits problem sparsity. The algorithms were implemented in the Julia programming language within the EAGO.jl package and demonstrated on five illustrative examples with varying complexity relevant in process systems engineering. The developed methods enable the guaranteed global solution of dynamic optimization problems with stiff ODE每IVPs embedded. ? 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers,Branch and bound method; Computer simulation; Dynamical systems; Global optimization; Initial value problems; Nonlinear equations; Ordinary differential equations; Problem oriented languages; Systems engineering; Deterministic global optimization; Dynamic optimization problem (DOP); Implicit function; Model-based systems engineering; Spatial branch and bounds; Stiff systems; Transient phenomenon; Unconditionally stable; Constrained optimization,"M.D. Stuber; Process Systems and Operations Research Laboratory, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Mansfield, United States; email: stuber@alum.mit.edu",John Wiley and Sons Inc.,Article,Scopus,,,1,,,,,

The TEAMS? failure-cause effect dependency model is a digital twin representation of the equipment in its failure-space and allows for various types of analyses such as testability, serviceability, failure propagation and others that facilitate fault management design of the equipment.

As concluded by several empirical studies during the past 10 years, applying MBSE methodology is no more a question and we shall now wonder how to do it rather than if we should. One of the major criticisms of MBSE remains about the available tooling to apply its methodology. Multiple surveys show that the usability of tools and the lack of skills from the user are two key barriers that still slow down the spread of the MBSE approach. In the meantime, these surveys also highlight the difficulties software engineers often encounter during the modeling activity itself, regardless of the tool. Indeed, complex operations such as problem-to-model mapping, consistency checking or error identification are still often manually performed by humans. The recent advances in AIs introduced new software-based systems able to interact with their users to help them in their daily life. The purpose of this PhD is to investigate how such AIs (which we will call software assistants) could help software engineers to face the complexity of software modeling. Interactions between software assistants and users of MBSE tools will be the bulk of this work. We plan to implement software assistants and provide them an access to a high-quality knowledge repository on models that we will build to study these interactions. Based on these studies, we hope to contribute laying the foundations of interactions with software assistants.

Thus, security and safety (S&S) issues should be taken into account with functional design as early as possible during the developing process. However, it's rare to see 'one-size-fits-all' modeling language and/or design tool. One way to solve this issue is to integrate different nature models into one model system, but this requires a unified semantic among modeling languages. We explore a model-based approach for systems engineering that facilitates the composition of several heterogeneous artifacts (called views) into a sound and consistent system model. Rather than trying to extend either SysML or SysML-sec into more expressive languages to add the missing features, we extract proper subsets of both languages to build a view adequate for conducting a security and safety analysis of Capella (SysML-based) functional models. Our language is generic enough to extract proper subsets of languages and combine them to build views for different experts. Moreover, it maintains a global consistency between the different views. ? 2019 IEEE.",Embedded systems; Safety engineering; Semantics; Software engineering; ARCADIA; Multi-views; Sys-ML Sec; SysML; TTool; UML like; Modeling languages,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,

In the future, as humans and machines learn and co-adapt in their mission context, systems engineering must develop approaches that support dynamic analysis and synthesis in both the design and operation of systems. The concept of a 'digital (mission) twin' provides an integration framework for design and control of future complex cyber-physical-human SoS. The framework builds on mission function task (MFT) analysis, providing a basis for model-based systems engineering (MBSE) activities to identify and address needs for automation or other forms of advanced technology that improve overall system performance. However, human-driven adaptation and eventually machine adaptation of complex SoS poses organizational and methodological challenges. We discuss the need for and opportunities for convergence of three often segregated SE methodologies: Product engineering, human systems integration, and mission/operations analysis by expanding the product or process engineering view of a digital twin to the mission level. In the present this gives us a framework to analyze and specify automation and adaptation opportunities at the mission level. In the future we envision this twin continuously operates with the real systems to manage both emergent mission conditions and lifecycle adaptation. We applied this framework to a complex military mission using a case where artificial intelligence can be incorporated widely across a set of mission tasks to significantly improve performance. ? 2019 IEEE.",Embedded systems; Engineering education; Life cycle; System of systems; Advanced technology; Analysis and synthesis; Design and operations; Human systems integration; Improve performance; Integration frameworks; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Product engineering; Cyber Physical System,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

Takeda M.; Hirata Y.; Weng Y.-H.; Katayama T.; Mizuta Y.; Koujina A.,Accountable system design architecture for embodied AI: a focus on physical human support robots,2019,Advanced Robotics,17,"Although the development of robot-based support systems for elderly people has become more popular, it is difficult for humans to understand the actions, plans, and behavior of autonomous robots and the reasons behind them, particularly when the robots include learning algorithms. Learning-based autonomous systems which are called AI are treated as an inherently untrustworthy ＆black box,＊ because machine learning or deep learning algorithms are difficult for humans to understand. Robot systems such as assistive robots, which work closely with humans, however, should be trusted. Systems should therefore achieve accountability for all stakeholders. However, most research in this field has focused on particular systems and situations, and no general design architecture exists. In this study, we propose a new design method, focused on accountability and transparency, for learning-based robot systems. Describing the entire system is a necessary first step, and transcribing the described system for each stakeholder based on several principles is effective for achieving accountability. The method improves transparency for systems, including learning algorithms. A standing assistive robot is used as an example of the entire system to clarify which system parts require greater transparency. This study adopted the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to describe the system and the described system is used for the information representation. Information should be represented considering the relationships between stakeholders, information, and the system interface. Because of their complexity, it is difficult for humans to understand the complete set of information available in robot systems. Systems should therefore present only the information required, depending on the situation. The stakeholder每interface relationship is also important because it is more beneficial for professionals to view information relevant to their specialized field, which would be difficult for others to understand. By contrast, the interface should be intuitive for general users. Visualization and sound are very useful means of transmitting information, with advantages and disadvantages for different circumstances. These relationships are important for achieving accountability. Finally, we show an example of implementation with a developed support system. It is confirmed that accountable systems can be designed based on the proposed design architecture. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and The Robotics Society of Japan.",Deep learning; Machine design; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Robots; Transparency; Assistive devices; Black boxes; Design architecture; Health-care managements; Human support robot; Information representation; Robot ethics; Systems modeling languages; Learning algorithms,"M.

Guariniello C.; Mockus L.; Raz A.K.; Delaurentis D.A.,Towards Intelligent Architecting of Aerospace System-of-Systems,2019,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,12,"System-of-Systems (SoS) are composed of large scale independent and complex heterogeneous systems which collaborate to create capabilities not achievable by a single system, for example air transportation system, satellite constellations, and space exploration architectures. Much of the research effort in the field of SoS has focused on the analysis of these complex entities, while there are still major gaps in developing tools for automated synthesis and engineering of SoS that consider all the various aspects in this problem domain. The gap we address in this paper is a mapping of clusters of SoS architecture alternatives, segmented by performance along multiple metrics, to architectural features. Building upon our previous research where we used a SoS Analytic Work Bench in combination with Model-Based Systems Engineering artifacts to perform analysis of aerospace systems, we propose to build a process for intelligent architecting of aerospace SoS. This process discovers and employs pertinent features in a complex design space to effectively meet the user needs, elevating SoS engineering from retrospective architectural analysis to automated synthesis of new architectures. As a first step towards intelligent architecture of aerospace SoS, we propose to utilize Machine Learning techniques to automate the synthesis phase of SoS. Our hypothesis is that a set of holistic metrics of aerospace architectures (cost, performance, robustness, operational risk, average delay, etc.) can be used to characterize a measure of goodness of architectures, with good architectures on a Pareto front of the multi-dimensional space of holistic metrics of interest. Each architecture or cluster may be then mapped to a set of architectural features, with the goal of identifying which features belong to good architectures. Specifically, we propose to utilize non-parametric regression on a set of training architectures (for example, Neural Networks can deal with mixed real and integer variables) to associate each one with a pattern of features. This mapping will allow the automated process to predict what metrics will be expected from SoS architectures with specific features, and therefore to automatically synthesize architectures that exhibit desired characteristics of goodness. For example, for constellations of satellites, a group of good architecture might have medium cost, high resilience, medium robustness, and low risk, and the architectural features to be mapped to each group can include number of satellites, number of components, type of orbit, type of power system, etc. Since the environment constantly evolves, architectures must adapt, and stochastic optimization can be used to switch between architectures with minimal effort. In this work we illustrate the new version of our aerospace SoS analysis and synthesis framework, which includes Machine Learning techniques to support synthesis of SoS architectures. We demonstrate the application of this process on satellite constellations and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps. ? 2019 IEEE.",Air transportation; Automation; Cluster computing; Complex networks; Engineering research; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Network architecture; Optimization; Orbits; Risk assessment; Satellites; Space research; System of systems; Air transportation systems; Complex heterogeneous systems; Intelligent architectures; Machine learning techniques; Model-based systems engineering; Non-parametric regression; Real and integer variables; Space exploration architecture; Computer architecture,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Orellana D.; Mandrick W.,The Ontology of Systems Engineering: Towards a Computational Digital Engineering Semantic Framework,2019,Procedia Computer Science,12,"The goal of implementing an enterprise digital engineering strategy is to improve data sharing throughout system conceptualization, development, manufacturing, operations, sustainment and their supporting organizations. Data sharing is a critical element of interoperability of models and other digital artifacts supporting the systems engineering process. Achieving interoperability within systems engineering requires eliminating differences of syntax and semantics to take advantage of automation, augmentation, and artificial intelligence capabilities that will increase process efficiency and artifact quality. This paper describes the development of a process-centric Systems Engineering (SE) reference ontology, based upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 Systems and Software Engineering - Life Cycle Processes [1]. The proposed SE reference ontology extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is a very small top-level ontology (TLO) designed specifically to support the integration of more specific ontologies that extend from it [2]. A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Arts computing; Engineering research; Knowledge management; Life cycle; Ontology; Semantics; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Basic formal ontologies; Digital engineering; Digital Thread; Information contents; MBSE; Model-based systems engineering; Systems modeling; Interoperability,"D.

Trustworthy adaptation requires that a system can be dynamically reconfigured at run-time without compromising the robustness and integrity of the system. Adaptive MILS extends MILS, a successful paradigm for rigorously developed and assured composable static systems, with reconfiguration mechanisms and a framework within which those mechanisms may be safely and securely employed for adaptation. In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing at run-time reconfigurations that are trustworthy taking into account the entwining of information flows and reconfigurations. The approach is based on a new extension of the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL), already used for specifying MILS policy architectures, which is now enhanced to specify the configuration state space in terms of parameters, the possible reconfigurations, monitoring properties and the related alarms. Supporting tools have been developed for the run-time synthesis of new architectural configurations that preserve safety and security properties formalized in terms of invariants and information flow. ?

Shahinfar S.; Kelman K.; Kahn L.,Prediction of sheep carcass traits from early-life records using machine learning,2019,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,29,"Currently hot carcass weight (HCW) and fat score jointly indicate the price grid for sheep meat in Australia. However, experts in the field believe that soon, yield and quality traits such as intramuscular fat (IMF), greville rule fat depth (GRFAT), computed tomography lean meat yield (CTLEAN), and loin weight (LW) are likely to play a role in pricing. Having an accurate prediction of these traits earlier in the life of an animal will allow sheep producers to adjust their management practices in order to achieve the target market requirements. Management, genetics, pasture and climate factors, influence these traits directly and epistatically. Traditional prediction methods may not be powerful enough to capture complex interactions while avoiding overfitting. In this case, learning algorithms that can learn from the current data to predict the animal's future performance offers promise. In this study, five different types of Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, namely Deep Learning (DL), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Model Tree (MT), and Random Forest (RF) were employed to predict HCW, IMF, GRFAT, LW and CTLEAN and their performances were compared against linear regression (LR) as the gold standard of multinomial prediction. Four scenarios representing different numbers of weight recordings -from a total of 9 weight measures taken between birth (WT1) and pre-slaughter (WT9)- were used to inform the algorithms and all models were trained and tested under equal conditions with identical training and testing sets. Selection of the most effective subset of predictor features were completed via greedy stepwise search among all the available features jointly with expert opinion. In predicting all the traits, RF was superior while LR and KNN showed the lowest prediction performance. When using the final model for predicting on an independent test set, the scenario with the most accurate prediction performance differed across traits. IMF and GRFAT were most accurately predicted when using birth, weaning, and pre-slaughter weights, while the most accurate scenario for HCW, LW and CTLEAN utilised weaning, six monthly weight measures after weaning and pre-slaughter weight. Across all scenarios the least accurate prediction was for IMF. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Australia; Animalia; Ovis aries; Adaptive boosting; Animals; Artificial intelligence; Computerized tomography; Decision trees; Deep learning; Forestry; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Carcass weight; Intramuscular fats; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Management practices; Market requirements; Prediction performance; Sheep; Training and testing; algorithm; artificial neural network; fat; machine learning; meat; performance assessment; prediction; regression analysis; sheep; weight; Forecasting,"S.

Berquand A.; Murdaca F.; Riccardi A.; Soares T.; Gener谷 S.; Brauer N.; Kumar K.,Artificial Intelligence for the Early Design Phases of Space Missions,2019,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,19,"Recent introduction of data mining methods has led to a paradigm shift in the way we can analyze space data. This paper demonstrates that Artificial Intelligence (AI), and especially the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR), could also be successfully employed at the start of the space mission life cycle via an Expert System (ES) used as a Design Engineering Assistant (DEA). An ES is an AI-based agent used to solve complex problems in particular fields. There are many examples of ES being successfully implemented in the aeronautical, agricultural, legal or medical fields. Applied to space mission design, and in particular, in the context of concurrent engineering sessions, an ES could serve as a knowledge engine and support the generation of the initial design inputs, provide easy and quick access to previous design decisions or push to explore new design options. Integrated to the User design environment, the DEA could become an active assistant following the design iterations and flagging model inconsistencies. Today, for space missions design, experts apply methods of concurrent engineering and Model-Based System Engineering, relying both on their implicit knowledge (i.e., past experiences, network) and on available explicit knowledge (i.e., past reports, publications, data sheets). The former knowledge type represents still the most significant amount of data, mostly unstructured, non-digital or digital data of various legacy formats. Searching for information through this data is highly time-consuming. A solution is to convert this data into structured data to be stored into a Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be traversed by an inference engine to provide reasoning and deductions on its nodes. Knowledge is extracted from the KG via a User Interface (UI) and a query engine providing reliable and relevant knowledge summaries to the Human experts. The DEA project aims to enhance the productivity of experts by providing them with new insights into a large amount of data accumulated in the field of space mission design. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) methods are leveraged to develop the DEA. Building the knowledge base manually is subjective, time-consuming, laborious and error bound. This is why the knowledge base generation and population rely on Ontology Learning (OL) methods. This OL approach follows a modified model of the Ontology Layer Cake. This paper describes the approach and the parameters used for the qualitative trade-off for the selection of the software to be adopted in the architecture of the ES. The study also displays the first results of the multi-word extraction and highlights the importance of Word Sense Disambiguation for the identification of synonyms in the context. This paper includes the detailed software architecture of both front and back-ends, as well as the tool requirements. Both architectures and requirements were refined after a set of interviews with experts from the European Space Agency. The paper finally presents the preliminary strategy to quantify and mitigate uncertainties within the ES. ? 2019 IEEE.",Concurrent engineering; Data handling; Economic and social effects; Engines; Expert systems; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Ontology; Space flight; User interfaces; European Space Agency; Human-machine interaction; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Model-based system engineerings; Multi word extraction; NAtural language processing; Searching for informations; Word Sense Disambiguation; Data mining,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Promyoo R.; Alai S.; El-Mounayri H.,Innovative digital manufacturing curriculum for industry 4.0,2019,,34,"Manufacturing companies across all major industries are facing serious challenges trying to competitively design and manage modern products, which are becoming increasingly complex multi-domain systems or ""systems of systems"". Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders' needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0. ? 2019 The Authors.

Madni A.M.; Madni C.C.; Lucero S.D.,Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering,2019,Systems,639,"Digital twin, a concept introduced in 2002, is becoming increasingly relevant to systems engineering and, more specifically, to model-based system engineering (MBSE). A digital twin, like a virtual prototype, is a dynamic digital representation of a physical system. However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter＊s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system＊s life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds. ? 2019 by the authors.

Delbr邦gger T.; Rossmann J.,Representing adaptation options in experimentable digital twins of production systems,2019,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,29,"Simulations are powerful tools for decision support during factory adaptation processes. In order to provide the most valuable form of decision support, a tool must take into account the decision problem and relevant decision alternatives. Today＊s simulation tools, however, only accept simple notions of variability, like numeric parameter ranges. Thereby they ignore most of the variability of production systems, and do not utilise their full potential to aid decisions. To improve this situation, a new concept on how to systematically model the variability of production systems in Digital Twins of production entities is proposed. It combines Model-Based Systems Engineering and Variability Management to model different variants of production systems, and utilises capabilities of production equipment to make Digital Twins modular and reconfigurable. Each valid combination of variants results in a directly 3D-simulable Digital Twin for the whole production system, allowing automatic validation testing and fast feedback loops during system development. The presented concept is not only a very important basis for managing variants. As the variants model can be used as a search space for optimisation algorithms, the concept is an important stepping stone for a more powerful simulation-based optimisation of production systems. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Models; Optimization; Systems engineering; capabilities; Digital twins; MBSE; Model-based systems engineering; Variability modelling; Virtual test beds; Decision support systems,"T.

In contrast to ""digital twins"", digital shadows are purposefully abstracted models of information emitted by the underlying CPPS, hence they do not manipulate the system themselves.We present a method to derive digital shadows from design-time models that can be extended with sophisticated analyses and operate physically distributed without changing the original models. To this end, tag models assign communication information to properties of design-time models from which we generate an Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) based communication infrastructure that makes these accessible to other models. This enables the flexible integration and exchange of model information at runtime without polluting these with extra communication information. We present a tagging language for model communication description, a systematic method to apply this to design-time models, generation of a communication infrastructure, and their implementations with the MontiCore language workbench. This, ultimately, facilitates engineering physically distributed digital shadows and, hence, facilitates developing the interconnected CPPS of the future.

Based on this, a modeling specification containing seven sub-processes is designed. In order to verify the correctness of CPS function and the consistency of the business logic at the primary phase of the design, we summarize the mapping rules of SysML-Modelica and define the algorithm of model conversion. Finally, a simple CPS case is used to verify our task. The results show that this method can be effective in CPS's modeling and Simulation. ? 2019 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

Due to the absence of a sufficient documentation, it cannot be retraced and optimized by other engineers. The use of expert systems, which apply a comprehensive knowledge base, is a possibility to reduce mistakes and make decisions more transparent. In this paper, a knowledge-based method for material selection is presented. Basis of the method is a knowledge base containing information about the properties of thermoplastics. This includes for example single- and multi-point-data, or facts like chemical resistances. Moreover, additional information concerning the modification of the properties, correlations, or the exact definitions are stored in the knowledge base. It also contains knowledge about production processes like standard injection molding, MuCell, or injection-compression molding restricting the number of suitable materials. Additional knowledge about the influence of part design for material selection completes the knowledge base. Considering the vast amount of available thermoplastics, the presented knowledge base includes selected examples. Based on this knowledge, a multistage method is developed using questionnaires to refine requirements and to exchange information between engineer and expert system. During the selection process, additional information, as it has been mentioned before, is given. At the end of the process, the user gets a ranking of possible materials. In addition, more detailed knowledge about their properties, advantages, and disadvantages are provided. For the development and the visualization of the method, System Modeling Language diagrams are used. These allow different views to the material selection method, the stages, and links between knowledge base and selection process. Finally, the results are discussed, and an outlook for development potential is given. ? 2019 Author(s).",\,"A.

Lyutov A.; Uygun Y.; H邦tt M.-T.,Managing workflow of customer requirements using machine learning,2019,Computers in Industry,14,"Customer requirements 每 product specifications issued by the customer 每 organize the dialog between suppliers and customers and, hence, affect the dynamics of supply networks. These large and complex documents are frequently updated over time, while changes are seldom marked by the customers who issue the requirements. The lack of structure and defined responsibilities, thus, demands an expert to manually process the requirements. Here, the possibility to improve the usual workflow with machine learning algorithms is explored. The whole requirements management process has two major bottlenecks, which can be automatized. The first one, detecting changes, can be accomplished via a document comparison tool. The second one, recognizing the responsibilities and assigning them to the right department, can be solved with standard machine learning algorithms. Here, such algorithms are applied to a dataset obtained from a global automotive industry supplier. The proposed method improves the requirements management process by reducing an expert's workload and thus decreasing the time for processing one document was reduced from 2 weeks to 1 h. Moreover, the method gives a high accuracy of department assignment and can self-improve once implemented into a requirements management system. Although the machine learning methods are very popular nowadays, they are seldom used to improve business processes in real companies, especially in the case of processes that did not require digitalization in the past. Here we show, how such methods can solve some of the management problems and improve their workflow. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Automation; Automotive industry; Classification (of information); Information retrieval systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Requirements engineering; Sales; Complex documents; Customer requirements; Machine learning methods; Management problems; Product specifications; Requirements management; Requirements management systems; Standard machines; Learning algorithms,"A.

Mahboob A.; Husung S.; Weber C.; Liebal A.; Kr?mker H.,The reuse of SysML behaviour models for creating product use cases in virtual reality,2019,Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design,7,"An early evaluation of a product along with the consideration of life phase specific actor(s) and environment(s) can help greatly to gain an understanding of the product's behaviour and interactions. Virtual Reality (VR) can help designers to examine later life situations of a product by means of use case scenarios. However, preparing a VR-scene is still a time-consuming and cumbersome task. A model based approach that uses behaviour models of SysML to describe a VR-scene can reduce the preparation efforts. Such an approach is helpful if it allows the reuse of already described VR-scenes or their contents. This paper talks about the reusability of SysML behaviour models that constitute a VR-scene. This reusability can only be achieved by the generic definition of model interfaces. Therefore, a new modelling approach is presented to facilitate the reuse of SysML behaviour models to form different use cases of a product in VR. This approach also talks about the interface definitions and the management of variants of SysML models. The presented approach is elaborated by an example model that contains variants and uses instances to build different use cases. ? 2019 Design Society.

Brown J.; Clendening R.; Stracener J.,Availability modeling for complex system design,2019,Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium,0,"According to the Manual For The Operation Of The Joint Capabilities Integration And Development System (JCIDS), Availability is one of three Sustainment Key Performance Parameters (KPP). A Complex System (CS), which may be a System of Systems (SoS), represents a growing majority of contractor developed defense systems. The primary purpose of the CS is to provide a needed capability, inherently improving mission availability and probability of success by using multiple systems to accomplish a mission. To date, availability is determined by factors such as the legacy system requirements and current maintenance task times.

Noorwali I.; Madhavji N.H.; Arruda D.; Ferrari R.,Towards a Meta-model for Requirements-Driven Information for Internal Stakeholders,2019,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2,"[Context & Motivation] Providing requirements-driven information (e.g., requirements volatility measures, requirements-design coverage information, requirements growth rates, etc.) falls within the realm of the requirements management process. The requirements engineer must derive and present the appropriate requirements information to the right internal stakeholders (IS) in the project. [Question/Problem] This process is made complex due to project-related factors such as numerous types of ISs, varying stakeholder concerns with regard to requirements, project sizes, a plethora of software artifacts, and many affected processes. However, there is little guidance in practice as to how these factors come into play together in providing the described information to the ISs. [Principle ideas/results] Based on analyzed data from an action research (AR) study we conducted in a large systems project in the rail-automation domain, we propose a meta-model that consists of the main entities and relationships involved in providing requirements-driven information to internal stakeholders within the context of a large systems project. The meta-model consists of five main entities and nine relationships that are further decomposed into three abstraction levels. We validated the meta-model in three phases by researchers and practitioners. [Benefits/Contribution] The meta-model is anticipated to facilitate: (i) control and management of process and resources for providing requirement-driven information to stakeholders and (ii) communication among internal stakeholders. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Computer software selection and evaluation; Requirements engineering; Empirical studies; Internal stakeholders; Meta model; Requirements management; Requirements metrics; Information management,"I.

Smart products are cyber physical systems with services through Internet connection. For example, smart vehicles equipped with advanced embedded intelligence are connected to other vehicles, people, and environment, and offer innovative data-driven services. Since smart products are software-intensive, data-driven, and service-conscious, their development clearly needs new capabilities underpinned by advanced tools, methods, and models.

While this generated a large number of novel and valuable techniques, tools, and methodologies in System-of-Systems Engineering, it also broadened the problem domains, and subsequently made it difficult to achieve a high degree of coordination and cohesion in the discipline. Previous attempts at creating a formal structure to System-of-Systems Engineering provided valuable support to practitioners, but have been sometimes disconnected from the current practical needs in the discipline, leaving behind some pain points that still need to be addressed. In this work, we propose a different perspective to deal with the pain points: based on our experience and on analysis of the current challenges of System-of-Systems Engineering, we identify potential research directions which are based on domain-agnostic methodology, but of interest to a variety of problems in System-of-Systems. This dual feature of the research directions is explored here to identify a connection between the necessity of establishing formal and generic procedures for System-of-Systems Engineering along with the usability and utility of practical tools and techniques for applied problems. ? 2019 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Health; Learning systems; System of systems; Degree of coordination; Domain agnostics; Formal structures; Generic procedures; Model-based systems engineering; Potential researches; Tools and techniques; Uncertainty quantifications; Engineering research,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,1

The modeling of those elements (agents and norms) together at design time can be a good way for a complete understanding of their structure and behavior. Multi-agent system modeling language (MAS-ML) supports the representation of NMAS entities, but the support for concepts related to norms is somewhat limited. MAS-ML is founded in taming agents and objects (TAO) framework and has a support tool called the MAS-ML tool. Goal: The present work aims to present a UML-based modeling language called normative multi-agent system (NorMAS-ML) able to model the MAS main entities along with the static normative elements. Method: We extend the TAO adding normative concepts and spread out those concepts in two syntaxes of MAS-ML. Either abstract, adding or updating metaclasses and stereotypes or concrete, defining new graphic elements for representing the elements defined in the abstract syntax. Besides, we evolve the MAS-ML tool, considering the extension of MAS-ML by the model-driven approach. Results: NorMAS-ML, the new version of MAS-ML, allows a complete view of NMAS entities and has a support tool called NorMAS-ML tool. Beyond the definition of NorMAS-ML and its tool, we generate a new static diagram called ""norm diagram"" supported by the NorMAS-ML tool. In order to illustrate the syntax of NorMAS-ML, the entities of a conference management system and its norms are modeled jointly. Conclusion: NorMAS-ML can help software designers (i) to understand the properties and behavior of NMAS entities and (ii) to provide a software modeling following the stakeholders' need and less complex for the development phase. ? 2019 The Author(s).",\,,University of Salamanca,Article,Scopus,,,,,,1,,

Hause M.,The Digital Twin Throughout the SE Lifecycle,2019,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"A digital twin is much as it sounds: a digital representation of a specific asset in the field, including current and past configuration states, considering serialized parts, software versions, options, and variants. Condition data is also represented including sensor readings, alerts, and operating environments. A digital twin has significant implications for service, operations, analysis, design, etc. especially when visualized as a Computer Aided Design (CAD)-sourced graphic in 3D virtual or augmented reality. Using this immersive and real-time information, engineers can inspect and verify the asset being serviced, designed or operated to get precise product information. However, the digital twin does not spring into life fully formed straight from the CAD model. It requires an informed system engineering approach to ensure that the integration between physical and digital is fit for purpose. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) models can be used in conjunction with the digital twin to improve operational models, predict and analyze faults, perform best-fit analysis and eliminate inappropriate system configurations, etc. This paper will look at various aspects of the digital twin and how it can be used in conjunction with MBSE.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,,,

(OED, 2018). The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and the Object Process Methodology (OPM) are two such frenemies. OPM and SysML are different means of achieving Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), each with their own benefits, issues, supporters and detractors. The National Defense Industry Association (NDIA) defines MBSE as ?an approach to engineering that uses models as an integral part of the technical baseline that includes the requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and verification of a capability, system, and/or product throughout the acquisition life cycle.? (NDIA, 2011) SysML is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and includes diagrams that can be used to specify system requirements, behavior, structure and parametric relationships. SysML provides a means of defining high-level abstract systems down to detailed physical systems. OPM is a ?conceptual modeling language and methodology for capturing knowledge and designing systems. Based on a minimal universal ontology of stateful objects and processes that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains.? (ISO, 2015) OPM is used in some systems engineering graduate courses. Students graduating from these institutions are struggling to integrate the differing styles, philosophies, concepts and processes of SysML and OPM. A literature search reveals some papers that contrast SysML and OPM, but none that describe how the two can work together.

Therefore, when the system model of a product is multidisciplinary it＊s not obvious what the parameters values describe the optimal state of the system.

Paucar L.H.G.; Bencomo N.,RE-STORM: Mapping the Decision-Making Problem and Non-Functional Requirements Trade-off to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes,2018,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,12,"Different model-based techniques have been used to model and underpin requirements management and decision-making strategies under uncertainty for self-adaptive Systems (SASs). The models specify how the partial or total fulfilment of non-functional requirements (NFRs) drive the decision-making process at runtime. There has been considerable progress in this research area. However, precarious progress has been made by the use of models at runtime using machine learning to deal with uncertainty and support decision-making based on new evidence learned during execution. New techniques are needed to systematically revise the current model and the satisficement of its NFRs when empirical evidence becomes available from the monitoring infrastructure. In this paper, we frame the decision-making problem and trade-off specifications of NFRs in terms of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) models. The mathematical probabilistic framework based on the concept of POMDPs serves as a runtime model that can be updated with new learned evidence to support reasoning about partial satisficement of NFRs and their trade-off under the new changes in the environment. In doing so, we demonstrate how our novel approach RE-STORM underpins reasoning over uncertainty and dynamic changes during the system's execution. ? 2018 ACM.",Adaptive systems; Behavioral research; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Software engineering; Specifications; Storms; Bayesian decision theory; POMDPs; requirements; Self adaptation; uncertainty; Decision making,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,1,,,

While a shift towards performance-based standards is underway by regulatory agencies to facilitate the entry into market of these technologies, it will need to be supported through the development and deployment of validated models and tools. The development of such capabilities will require a paradigm shift where physical experiments and vehicle testing are not conducted for the sole purpose of verification and validation around a point solution but rather with the intent to decrease epistemic uncertainty and better handle the aleatory uncertainty. Such efforts can significantly benefit from an MBSE-enabled Digital Thread/Digital Twin approach to aircraft design. However, an element is currently missing from on-going discussions about the Digital Thread/Digital Twin that is critical to the development of validated capabilities. This missing piece, a reasoning formalism that provides an all-encompassing framework to define and develop systems that are designed to operate based on intelligent functionalities, is introduced in this paper. Titled NOESIS, this reasoning formalism leverages the semantics of the Greek language to identify and distinguish between different modes of reasoning aimed at providing additional layers of thinking and analysis. Illustrated through the development and application of a data-rich Digital Twin, this formalism is expected to contribute to the larger goal of developing intelligent systems, support the design on board prognostics, diagnostics, health monitoring systems and eventually guide and facilitate the design of adaptive systems. ? 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",Aviation; Semantics; Uncertainty analysis; Cutting edge technology; Design and Development; Epistemic uncertainties; Experiment testing; Paradigm shifts; Performance Based Standards; Physical experiments; Regulatory agencies; Vehicle testing; Verification-and-validation; Intelligent systems,,"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,1,

Using a model based systems engineering approach enables design space exploration methods which provide such automations, formalizing the problem in order to be solvable e.g. by SMT solvers. However, due to the complexity of the systems, those problems cannot be efficiently solved. It is thus furthermore required to provide mechanisms to reduce the complexity.

Mordecai Y.,Conceptual modeling of cyber-physical gaps in air traffic control,2018,Procedia Computer Science,6,"On March 8, 2014, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 carrying flight MH-370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared during its flight. In this paper, we employ a model-based approach to capture and study the chain of events leading to the disappearance of the aircraft. We show that the critical reason for the aircraft's disappearance was a cyber-physical gap (CPG). The CPG is the difference between the real state of a physical entity and its state as perceived by cybernetic agents. Failure to acknowledge the CPG's existence, capture it in system models, and incorporate suitable mitigation mechanisms into systems exposed to CPG, has resulted in the past and may result in the future in severe consequences. In the MH-370 case, the plane's position and adherence to its flight course were misperceived by the air traffic control, resulting in failure to track and find the plane, to this day. Our approach to CPG analysis has been previously shown to assist both designers and users handle emergent situations resulting from CPGs, such as the Three-Mile Island nuclear reactor's partial meltdown accident in 1979. We propose several mitigation mechanisms, whose integration with air traffic control systems could help prevent similar cases in the future. ? 2018 The Authors.

Hajri I.; Goknil A.; Briand L.C.; Stephany T.,Configuring use case models in product families,2018,Software and Systems Modeling,17,"In many domains such as automotive and avionics, the size and complexity of software systems is quickly increasing. At the same time, many stakeholders tend to be involved in the development of such systems, which typically must also be configured for multiple customers with varying needs. Product Line Engineering (PLE) is therefore an inevitable practice for such systems. Furthermore, because in many areas requirements must be explicit and traceability to them is required by standards, use cases and domain models are common practice for requirements elicitation and analysis. In this paper, based on the above observations, we aim at supporting PLE in the context of use case-centric development. Therefore, we propose, apply, and assess a use case-driven configuration approach which interactively receives configuration decisions from the analysts to generate product-specific (PS) use case and domain models. Our approach provides the following: (1) a use case-centric product line modeling method (PUM), (2) automated, interactive configuration support based on PUM, and (3) an automatic generation of PS use case and domain models from Product Line (PL) models and configuration decisions. The approach is supported by a tool relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and integrated with an industrial requirements management tool, i.e., IBM DOORS. We successfully applied and evaluated our approach to an industrial case study in the automotive domain, thus showing evidence that the approach is practical and beneficial to capture variability at the appropriate level of granularity and to configure PS use case and domain models in industrial settings. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Requirements engineering; Configuration; Configuration supports; Consistency checking; Industrial case study; Industrial requirements; Product line engineering; Requirements elicitation; Use-case; Natural language processing systems,"I.

Mahboob A.; Husung S.; Weber C.; Liebal A.; Kr?mker H.,An approach for building product use-case scenarios in different virtual reality systems,2018,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,6,"During the product development process, it is of great importance to consider the later life phase situations of a product. This includes the interaction of the product with its environment and the human actor(s) in its different life phases. Therefore, an early evaluation of a product and its later life phase interactions are of great value. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is seen as very important at this point, as it can help the designer to realize the later life phase situations of a product inside VR. However, the preparation of VR-scenes remains a difficult task, as it requires a great amount of time and effort. Furthermore, the current methods for the preparation of such scenes offer very limited reusability. This paper will focus on an existing method that uses Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to describe the VR-scene for a CAVE-type VR-system. This method will be further extended and an improvement to the existing modeling approach will be presented to achieve a faster simulation in VR and reusability of VR-scenes. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of the conventional and the new approach will be presented. The new approach enables a faster simulation that will be validated by comparing the execution speed of both approaches under the modeling approach section. The reusability perspective of the prepared VR-scene will also be discussed.

For this reason a continuous need for sophisticated cross-domain methodologies in order to handle complexity and to create reliable systems persists. This paper introduces a systematic approach for a methodology that connects the worlds from different engineering domains leading to a modeling and simulation-based engineering concept. Central aspect of this concept is the consequent application of modeling and simulation techniques at each stage of the development process to support both, the design and verification process. The paper further presents a realization approach for a simulation framework based on Experimentable Digital Twins and Virtual Testbeds.

This term, alongside the Digital Twin, have been an active area of research in the U.S Department of Defense, Lockheed Martin, Siemens, Georgia Institute of Technology and many others for several years. What is interesting to notice is that usually whenever these terms are brought up, references to Model-Based Systems Engineering and the Internet of Things arose which sometimes blurs the lines between the use and application of each of these concepts. Their definitions suggest that while they are very different from each other, some common traits can be traced such as integration and data management. This paper will attempt to further investigate the concept of the Digital Thread to eventually reach a unique and seamless definition. Experts identified the Digital Thread as a game changer in aircraft industry. However due to the proprietary nature of this industry, there is no unique reference in the literature that can be used as a standard. This paper will also investigate some implementations of the Digital Thread to mark the commonalities for a standardized implementation strategy. Finally, this paper will present the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory approach to enable the Digital Thread with a suggested implementation strategy that could potentially serve as a standard or a reference for future research. ? 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The goal of this paper is to empirically investigate if the trace links in the simulation result can assist in validating a virtual Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in the context of System Modeling Language (SysML). We integrate the concept of obstacle analysis to recover situations in which a safety requirement will not be satisfied. Therefore, we use fault tree analysis to validate the safety requirements, and further use the elements of the fault tree to evaluate the quality of the automatically recovered trace links. We showed that the identified impacts of assuring virtual PLC (V-PLC) elements using traceability information can be reused to ensure a number of other PLCs or requirements in the systems models.

Cyber physical systems are increasing scale and complexity with the growing pervasiveness of ICT and the development of the smart worlds such as smart factory, smart robotics, smart grids, smart cities, smart vehicles, smart healthcare systems, and smart homes. The growing interconnection of physical and virtual worlds of complex cyber physical systems, and the development of increasingly sophisticated intelligence techniques, has given rise to the next generation of CPS, that is referred to as smart cyber-physical systems (sCPS) which can efficiently operate, manage and control physical world and virtual world, and offer broad range of novel applications and services. Thus, smart cyber physical systems are complex cyber physical systems endowed with intelligent abilities. The main characteristic of such a new generation of smart cyber physical systems is the ability to interact with the physical worlds and adapt to new working environments through distributed intelligent mechanisms that executing and operating at the unit (single device), cluster (groups of devices) and network level (the network of devices). The properties like uncertainties, safety, reliability, and performance requirement, spatial-temporal requirement, and adaptation ability are very important, modeling smart cyber-physical systems must face these challenges and satisfy these specific requiremnts. In order to specify and model such kind of systems, we propose a new paradigm for specifying and modeling smart cyber physical systems based on software defined approach using Modelicaml. Software defined approach is a new way that help abstract the real world and virtual world with software components, this approach can simplify system specification, modeling and design. The main aim of ModelicaML is to enable an efficient and effective way to use Modelica, UML and SysML models reusing notations that are also used for software modeling based on software defined approach.

Requirements are usually expressed partly or totally in a natural language (NL) format and come from different documents. Their qualities are difficult to analyze manually, especially when hundreds of thousands of them have to be considered. The assistance of software tools is becoming a necessity. In this article, the goal was to develop a set of metrics supported by NL processing (NLP) methods supporting different types of analysis of requirements and especially the dependencies between requirements. An NLP approach is used to extract requirements from text; to analyze their quality, links, similarities, and contradictions; and to cluster them automatically. The analysis framework includes different combinations of methods such as cosine similarity, singular value decomposition, and K-means clustering. One objective is to assess the possible combinations and their impacts on detections to establish optimal metrics. Three case studies exemplify and support the validation of the work. Graphs are used to represent the automatically clustered requirements, as well as similarities and contradictions. A new contradiction analysis process that includes a rules-based approach is proposed. Finally, the combined results are presented as graphs, which unveil the semantic relationships between requirements. Subsection 4.8 compares the results provided by the tool and the results obtained from experts. The proposed methodology and network presentation not only support the understanding of the semantics of the requirements but also help requirements engineers to review the interconnections and consistency of requirements systems and manage traceability. The approach is valuable during the early phases of projects when requirements are evolving dynamically and rapidly. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Natural language processing systems; Requirements engineering; Semantics; Contradiction analysis; Contradictions analysis; Graph representation; Network representation; Requirements management; Rules-based approaches; Semantic relationships; Similarity; Singular value decomposition,"E.

"Hause M., Ashfield S.",The Oil and Gas Digital Engineering Journey,2018,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases. The INCOSE Integrated Systems Engineering Vision 2025 [INCOSE, 2014] describes how future systems engineering tools will facilitate systems engineering practices as part of a fully integrated engineering environment. A shift towards an integrated, digital engineering environment enables rapid transformation of concepts and designs to digitalized virtual prototypes and then to physical prototypes through the application of additive manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printers and the digital twin in operations. This capability enables engineers to rapidly and continually assess and update their designs prior to committing costs to production hardware. Implementing this vision will require an integrated suite of tools, technologies, and standards to support the full systems engineering and product lifecycles from requirements to design to implementation and maintenance. MBSE models are digital and executable, and using an MBSE simulation engine, they can shift risk towards early stages of project development as the asset can be tested before it is built. In operations, IoT technologies enable companies to capture and leverage information about a product's performance during operation ? with the potential to dramatically improve existing and future products.

This paper describes the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach employed by Fincantieri for the definition and analysis of the whole warship level architecture, starting from mission analyses, and generating NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) based engineering views to describe the response provided by the system-of-interest, represented ? in this specific case ? by the new first line Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) surface combat units for Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) SEA5000 program. Many benefits derive from the implementation of the MBSE/NAF approach (such as the continuous traceability among the different domains of the architecture, the optimization of communications between customer and supplier, and a solid support for the verification of the Whole Warship performance), as discussed in the following chapters, and summarized in the conclusions. The system offered to RAN strictly derives from a consolidated system of success, which is currently employed by the Italian Navy (Marina Militare Italiana ?

"Owens III S., Dukes A., Daly S.",A Pilot Study to Determine MBSE Utility for Process Modeling of Complex Interfaces,2018,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Modeling a full system or a complete interface between systems in a MBSE environment is a very large task and not all organizations will benefit enough from using MBSE to offset the effort that is required to do this. Completely modeling a system or interface is not necessary to evaluate the utility of MBSE for a specific application or organization. The first step in any new and ambitious endeavor is to first demonstrate its utility. A small pilot can be executed over a short period of time that only models small portions of a system or interface and, if structured properly, this pilot can successfully demonstrate the utility of MBSE for an organization before having to invest a larger amount of resources to fully implement and deploy MBSE. This paper documents one such pilot that was conducted for NASA's Launch Services Program Integration Engineering organization in the hope that this example will lead the way for others to take a similar ?one step at a time? approach.

Requirement changes originate from a wide variety of sources. Business analysts gather these requirements, resolve con.icts, analyze impacts, and prepare actionable improvement plans. These tasks require a comprehensive knowledge of business processes and other entities within the organization. Business process model repositories, which may contain hundreds of models, are important sources of such cross-functional information. In this study, we introduce an approach which facilitates business process improvement by utilizing the comprehensive information covered by process models. Speci.cally, we associate requirements with other organizational entities based on their transitive relations with process models. To infer these associations, our approach makes use of natural language processing techniques and enterprise semantics. A quantitative evaluation of our approach, which took place within a major telecommunication company, displayed that it accurately detects associations between requirements and process models. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews with business analysts revealed that their expectations are high on effciency increases due to the usage of this approach. ? 2017 ACM.",Natural language processing systems; Process engineering; Semantics; Business process improvement; Business process model; Comprehensive information; Process Modeling; Quantitative evaluation; Requirements management; Semi structured interviews; Telecommunication companies; Knowledge management,,Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

Xu W.; Wang L.; Pan H.; Lu K.,Application of model based systems engineering in virtual tests of the spacecraft,2017,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",0,"The design of the spacecraft is complex system engineering due to the complexity and multidisciplinary nature of space systems. On the one hand, the spacecraft is becoming more and more complex, especially for multidisciplinary problems to solve structure system, electrical system, flight control system, power system, environmental system. On the other hand, in the design processing, a spacecraft is designed and integrated by different research institutes or suppliers of products, and in the early stage of design it is a Gordian knot to accredit the reliability of the spacecraft through the integrated system tests. This indicates that the spacecraft engineers should consider all relevant aspects of the space product life cycle. In this paper, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) platform for the spacecraft virtual simulation of multi domain physical system was constructed. The prototype was specified on the requirement definition, system physical design, spacecraft performance analysis and optimization, function analysis and verification of the spacecraft. The performance evaluation and virtual flight test of the spacecraft system are completed with this MBSE platform. Based on the model with a multidisciplinary collaborative simulation, a unified data source specification and standard design flow model is established. Compared with the traditional text based design, MBSE can be used to analyse the requirements of the system at all stages of the design, and verify whether the system requirements are in line with the original requirements of stakeholders. The use of a variety of models enables the move from a document centric to a model based approach powered by multidisciplinary coupling. Through the use of such tools, requirement correctness can be validated in every stages of design and complex interfaces can be analysed. The critical aspects of their specific metrics and key parameters as the design evolves can be timely verified and updated. This can ensure that the system design to meet the system function and capability requirements and achieve the optimal design of the integrated system.

Cygnus has seven successful resupply missions to the ISS, with four additional missions scheduled under CRS1 and a minimum of six missions under CRS2. Orbital ATK is taking the experience learned from the Cygnus missions and applying them to their NextSTEP (Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partners) contract, which is looking at adapting a Cygnus vehicle into a habitat for deep space exploration. This paper will look at using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodology and System Modeling Language (SysML) to develop a reference architecture of the Cygnus spacecraft. Once the reference architecture is developed, the SysML model will be used to optimize the development of a Cygnus derived cislunar habitat architecture for deep space exploration. The cislunar habitat will support NASA＊s Journey to Mars exploration architecture. The reference architecture approach will allow for a future variant of the Cygnus spacecraft to be developed and tested in a virtual environment, saving the company development time and costs. ? 2017 by Orbital ATK.",Architecture; Ecosystems; Interplanetary flight; Martian surface analysis; NASA; Orbits; Space stations; Virtual reality; Deep space; Deep-space exploration; Feasibility studies; International Space stations; Model-based system engineerings; Orbitals; Reference architecture; Resupply; Space habitat; System models; Modeling languages,,"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA",Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,

Bhatia G.V.; Mesmer B.L.,Integrating SysML and value-based design with an NEA scout small satellite example,2017,"AIAA SPACE and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2017",0,"There has recently been a tremendous growth in the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) among different categories of practitioners including government, industry, and academia. MBSE aims at using a consistent system model that is updated throughout the system life cycle to form a digital twin, to enable improved decision-making. OMG＊s Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is one of the primary modeling languages used to model not only system hardware and software, but also the people and processes involved in system development. SysML is finding increased application in different sectors, and is gaining favor among practitioners for their modeling needs. Value-based design (VBD) mathematically represents the preference of the stakeholder in the form of a value model which can be maximized to determine the optimal system. This paper attempts to bring together the benefits of SysML and value modeling to enable more informed decisions. This is performed by integrating value models with SysML to evaluate and compare alternatives. The challenges to integrating the two approaches are discussed and an example of the NEA Scout cube satellite modeled in Cameo Enterprise Architecture with stakeholder preference represented mathematically in a value model is used to explore the topic. ? 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Schluse M.; Atorf L.; Rossmann J.,Experimentable digital twins for model-based systems engineering and simulation-based development,2017,"11th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, SysCon 2017 - Proceedings",72,"The concepts and methodologies behind Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) hold great promises concerning the development of complex systems. Various projects have been carried out successfully during the last years and demonstrated the power behind the overall concept - and the practical problems to reach the ambitious overall goals. Whereas the first steps of MBSE like the iterative modeling of requirements, designs, behaviors, and tests became standard procedures in Systems Engineering (SE), the transition to simulation often is still restricted to quite simple scenarios. Although elaborated system models deliver all the information needed, the simulation of the overall system in prospective working environments interacting with other systems is rather an exception. The problem is that there is still quite a gap between the first SE steps and the various algorithms simulation technology can offer today. Major reasons for this seem to be the resulting complexity of the system model when modeling complex interactions, the complexity of using state-of-the-art simulation technology and the absence of simulation frameworks for simulations across multiple domains and disciplines. ""Experimentable Digital Twins"", a concept originally developed for the eRobotics methodology, seem to have the potential to close the gap between SE and simulation by introducing a new structuring element to configure simulations. A new simulation system architecture integrating well-known simulation algorithms provides Virtual Testbeds for the simultaneous simulation of a network of different Digital Twins interacting with each other in various ways (i.e. a network of different systems, their components and their working environment). This approach has been successfully used for a variety of different applications in multiple research areas. As one application, it allows for the simulation-based optimization of parameters, system structure etc. ? 2017 IEEE.",Complex networks; Iterative methods; Optimization; Systems engineering; Testbeds; Erobotics; Experimentable Digital Twin; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Simulation algorithms; Simulation technologies; Simulation-based optimizations; Virtual test beds; Virtual reality,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

"Hause M., Wilson M.",Integrated Human Factors Views in the Unified Architecture Framework,2017,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Human beings are integral to today's complex systems of systems. Human behaviour, interactions, abilities, complexity, and limitations will have a dramatic effect on the successful realization of system capabilities. Therefore the human factors considerations need to be evaluated in conjunction with the overall systems engineering. Systems engineers need to address them upfront and throughout the system life cycle resulting in effective Human Systems Integration (HSI). Systems engineers are increasingly using Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques to define systems requirements, behaviour, structure, interactions, etc. Typical architecture notations are the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) for modelling systems and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM). The metamodels defining these notations contain implicit, but not explicit elements for defining how the human fits into the architecture. The Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) has standardized a set of Human Views (called Personnel Views in UAF) into its system of systems framework, allowing the Human aspects to be considered in conjunctions with the rest of the architecture. The UAF Personnel views will not be standalone, but like SysML will allow users to interface with specialty to analyse human aspects in both quantitative and qualitative ways. It is only by taking this integrated approach that systems can be fit for purpose by including the human impact and contribution to overall system performance. This paper will describe these views and how they fit into the overall architecture as well as how they can interact with a spectrum of human factors and architecture tools.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Performing this analysis manually is expensive, particularly for complex systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically identify the impact of requirements changes on system design, when the requirements and design elements are expressed using models. We ground our approach on the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) due to SysML's increasing use in industrial applications. Our approach has two steps: For a given change, we first apply a static slicing algorithm to extract an estimated set of impacted model elements. Next, we rank the elements of the resulting set according to a quantitative measure designed to predict how likely it is for each element to be impacted. The measure is computed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to the textual content of the elements. Engineers can then inspect the ranked list of elements and identify those that are actually impacted. We evaluate our approach on an industrial case study with 16 real-world requirements changes. Our results suggest that, using our approach, engineers need to inspect on average only 4.8% of the entire design in order to identify the actually-impacted elements. We further show that our results consistently improve when our analysis takes into account both structural and behavioral diagrams rather than only structural ones, and the natural-language content of the diagrams in addition to only their structural and behavioral content. ? 2016 ACM.",Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Change impact analysis; Model slicing; NAtural language processing; SysML; Traceability information; Structural analysis,,Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

This vision of a Total System Model as the digital blueprint (or digital twin) of a system, federating models in multiple vendor tools and configuration-controlled repositories, has gained tremendous support from the practitioners. A software platform, Syndeia, developed by Intercax, provides capabilities for seamless model-based communication between systems engineering and X (where X = mechanical/electrical, simulation, PLM, ALM, project management, and other disciplines), replacing the existing document-centric approaches. This paper elaborates research and development performed by NASA JPL and Intercax for integrating system architecture models (SysML) and mechanical design models (CAD) with applications to the Europa Clipper Mission. Specifically, this paper demonstrates (1) seeding of mechanical design models from system specifications (SysML) as a starting point for mechanical design, (2) model-based connections between system and mechanical design parameters, including compare and bi-directional synchronization, (3) abstracting system architecture from mechanical assemblies for transitioning existing/old projects to a model-based systems approach, and (4) use of persistent, fine-grained connections between system architecture and mechanical design models for continuous verification and communication between the two disciplines.

In safety-related applications, as in the automotive domain, this necessity is more pronounced because of the regulations and standards imposed by authorities.

Emebo O.; Olawande D.; Charles A.,An automated tool support for managing implicit requirements using Analogy-based Reasoning,2016,Proceedings - International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science,5,"Systems requirements are crucial to the proper functioning of a software and must be met for a project to be successful. Hence the need for its effective management. Implicit Requirements (IMRs) however are difficult to manage as a result of their nature-vague, unclear, and ambiguous amongst other characteristics. The process of requirement management is a continuous cycle as change in requirements and emergence of new requirements occur in a system. Hence the need for a tool/approach which identifies and manages requirements (implicit and explicit) effectively. However, most systems do not manage implicit requirements as a lot of attention is focused on explicit requirements. This research presents an approach for identification and management of IMRs using Analogy-based Reasoning in combination with two other core technologies (Ontology and Natural Language Processing). The approach is supported by a prototype tool, which was assessed by conducting a preliminary evaluation. The results indicate that the approach enables for early identification of IMRs when used with a good domain ontology and is potentially suitable for application in practice by experts. ? 2016 IEEE.",Information science; Ontology; Analogy-based reasoning; Automated tool support; Change in requirements; implicit requirement; NAtural language processing; Requirement engineering; Requirement management; Systems requirements; Natural language processing systems,,IEEE Computer Society,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,
Misra J.,Terminological inconsistency analysis of natural language requirements,2016,Information and Software Technology,10,"Context: Terminological inconsistencies owing to errors in usage of terms in requirements specifications could result into subtle yet critical problems in interpreting and applying these specifications into various phases of SDLC. Objective: In this paper, we consider special class of terminological inconsistencies arising from term-aliasing, wherein multiple terms spread across a corpus of natural language text requirements may be referring to the same entity. Identification of such alias entity-terms is a difficult problem for manual analysis as well as for developing tool support. Method: We consider the case of syntactic as well as semantic aliasing and propose a systematic approach for identifying these. Identification of syntactic aliasing involves automated generation of patterns for identifying syntactic variances of terms including abbreviations and introduced-aliases. Identification of semantic aliasing involves extracting multidimensional features (linguistic, statistical, and locational) from given requirement text to estimate semantic relatedness among terms. Based upon the estimated relatedness and standard language database based refinement, clusters of potential semantic aliases are generated. Results of these analyses with user refinement lead to generation of entity-term alias glossary and unification of term usage across requirements. Results: A prototype tool was developed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach for an automated analysis of term-aliasing in the requirements given as plain English language text. Experimental results suggest that approach is effective in identifying syntactic as well as semantic aliases, however, when aiming for higher recall on larger corpus, user selection is necessary to eliminate false positives. Conclusion: This proposed approach reduces the time-consuming and error-prone task of identifying multiple terms which might be referring to the same entity to a process of tool assisted identification of such term-aliases. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Coolahan J.E.,Realizing a collaborative M&S environment for system acquisition from five key components,2016,"2016 Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2016",0,"The concept for a collaborative modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to aid in the acquisition of a system is not new. As early as 1998, a reference architecture for such an environment was suggested in a study on what was then known as Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) by the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). Two major U.S. defense programs, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and the Future Combat Systems (FCS), proposed to construct such an environment in their early M&S planning documents, although the vision, as proposed, was not fully realized in either program. Nevertheless, the use of M&S in a collaborative fashion involving both government and industry stakeholders remains of significant interest in the system acquisition community. Since those original attempts, computer and network technology has advanced significantly, a number of consensusbased M&S-related standards have emerged and evolved, and concepts such as Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) promoted by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) have garnered increased interest. Additionally, in the last few years, renewed interest has emerged in government systems engineering organizations surrounding such ideas as the Digital System Model (DSM, by OSD) and the Digital Thread and Digital Twin (by the U.S. Air Force). There have also been studies performed by the M&S Committee of the Systems Engineering Division of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) on identifying M&S capabilities used in the acquisition lifecycle and on defining the essential elements of the DSM. Further, an Acquisition M&S Standards Profile is being developed within the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO). This paper delineates five key components that are needed to realize a modern collaborative M&S environment for system acquisition. These components include three layers: an infrastructure layer, a data/information layer, and a modeling/simulation tools layer; and two overlays: a standards overlay and a policies/processes overlay. It provides an overall description of the relationships among the components, and discusses in more detail the major subcomponents of the three layer components, including the DSM as a key subcomponent of the data/information/layer. It provides examples of specific potential elements within each component, and how those elements may differ depending on the type of system being acquired.

Yuan W.; Liu Y.; Zhao J.; Wang H.,Pattern-based integration of system optimization in mechatronic system design,2016,Advances in Engineering Software,11,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a promising methodology for the design of complex mechatronic systems. There are some tools developed to support MBSE in complex system design and modeling. However, none of them has got the functionality of supporting system optimization. This work is precisely motivated by this gap and aims to develop effective methods to support automatic system optimization for MBSE. Specifically, a pattern-based method is proposed to support the integration of system optimization into mechatronic system design. In such a method, optimization problems, their solving methods and computation results are formally defined in each pattern based on the System Modeling Language (SysML). In addition, a model description scheme termed an optimization profile is proposed based on SysML to include the components for formalizing different kinds of optimization problems and optimization methods. After an optimization profile is created for an optimization problem, system optimization methods can be chosen automatically from the pattern library based on a semantic similarity evaluation. Then, optimization results are provided to users to support decision-making and the pattern library is updated using the relevant information obtained in this process. A system design example is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed methods. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Patwari P.; Chaudhuri S.R.; Natarajan S.; Muralikrishna G.,M&C ML: A modeling language for monitoring and control systems,2016,Fusion Engineering and Design,6,"The use of System Engineering (SE) language such as SysML [1,20] is common within the community of control system designers. However the design handoff to the subsequent phases of the control system development is carried out manually in most cases without much tool support. The approach to agreeing on the control interface between components is a good example where engineers still rely on either manually created Interface Control Documents (ICD) or one off tools implemented by individual projects. Square Kilometer Array (SKA) [2] and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) [3] are two good examples of such large projects adopting these approaches. This results in non-uniformity in the overall system design since individual groups invent their own vocabulary while using a language like SysML which leads to inconsistencies across the design, interface and realized code. To mitigate this, we propose the development of a Monitoring and Control Modeling Language (M&CML), a domain specific language (DSL) [4,22] for specifying M&C solutions. M&C ML starts with defining a vocabulary borrowing concepts from standard practices used in the control domain and incorporates a language which ensures uniformity and consistency across the M&C design, interfaces and implementation artifacts.

This is a collaborative project being developed under the European Union Clean Sky 2 Program, a public-private partnership bringing together aeronautics industrial leaders and public research organizations based in Europe. The provision of integrated modeling, simulation, and optimization tools to effectively support all stages of aircraft design remains a critical challenge in the Aerospace industry. In particular the high level of system integration that is characteristic of new aircraft designs is dramatically increasing the complexity of both design and verification. Simultaneously, the multi-physics interactions between structural, electrical, thermal, and hydraulic components have become more significant as the systems become increasingly interconnected. The aim of MISSION is to develop and demonstrate an integrated modeling, simulation, design and optimization framework incorporating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) principles oriented to the Aerospace industry. This framework will holistically support the design, development and validation process of an aircraft, starting from conceptual aircraft-level design, toward capture of key requirements, system design, software design, integration, validation and verification. In order to achieve this goal, MISSION will deliver a core modeling and simulation environment, primarily based on the Modelica language for modeling of multi-physics systems, which incorporates dedicated platforms and toolsets for aircraft-level design and optimization, system-level design and optimization, model-based controls and virtual testing.

Chami M.; Bruel J.-M.,Towards an integrated conceptual design evaluation of mechatronic systems: The SysDICE approach,2015,Procedia Computer Science,20,"Mechatronic systems play a significant role in different types of industry, especially in transportation, aerospace, automotive and manufacturing. Although their multidisciplinary nature provides enormous functionalities, it is still one of the substantial challenges which frequently impede their design process. Notably, the conceptual design phase aggregates various engineering disciplines, project and business management fields, where different methods, modeling languages and software tools are applied. Therefore, an integrated environment is required to intimately engage the different domains together. This paper outlines a model-based research approach for an integrated conceptual design evaluation of mechatronic systems using SysML.

Due to the complexity of production development such as automotive, software industry and the aerospace industry, managing requirements is indispensable and challenging. Products in these industries are constantly being updated and modified as the understanding of risks increases with experience and new products are developed in light of such risk. Therefore, the traceability links among the requirements artifacts, which fulfill business objectives, is so critical to reducing the risk and ensuring the success of products. To that end, this paper propose a semantic based traceability link recovery (STLR) architecture. According to best of our knowledge this is the first architectural approach that uses DBpedia knowledge-base and Bablenet 2.5 multilingual dictionary and semantic network for finding similarity among requirements and the automation of the recovery traceability links using our novel Triple extraction, and Triple disambiguation algorithm.

Mars gravity is about l/3rd of Earth's, asteroid and dwarf planets even less. Training for Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) using rovers and spacesuits is challenging at best. Lower gravity planetary environments with distinctive terrain require trained space explorers with interactive human-machine compatibilities. Current visualization methods, such as Virtual Reality (VR) goggles, can be adapted to display a generalized view of planetary surface featuring a visual 3-D interface, yet lack a high-fidelity, immersive environment. Limited terrain mapping and limited methods for reflecting the variable gravitational conditions are two of the primary limitations. In order to better understand human behavior in alternate environments, it is important to study the psycho-physiological components of a subject in a near-Actual simulations. With the potential to augment planetary EVA procedures and address vital human factors associated with space planetary exploration, our team in partnership with the University of North Dakota (UND) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have developed the concept of VISR (Visual Immersion for Simulated Robotics) system. VISR provides an immersive 3-D planetary Virtual Reality model utilizing high performance computing, image processing, 3-D rendering, powered by an expansive referential database. The software manipulates image processing speed with a variable gravity parameter as an input. VISR is compatible with multiple planetary bodies and asteroids whereas the current system applications are limited to the space station and Mars. VISR assists in the study of psycho-physiological effects (human limbs - eye coordination) associated with deep-space travel and low- gravity environments. VISR can be utilized to facilitate short range tele-robotic operation during actual missions. Mars has a vast, geologically complex terrain with existing environments models allowing topographical visualization. Image composition draws upon the significant wealth of information accumulated at JPL over 50 years interacting with solar system bodies. VISR users experience these features in an immersive and interactive environment enhancing human performance in real situations, and assisting scientists and mission planners in system and mission design. VISR integrates the UND developed planetary suit NDX-2, currently used as a simulation tool for 'astronaut training', the LEGACY database for planetary bodies at JPL, human factors and related Psychophysiological studies. The VISR system development will has seen different phases such as development of terrain maps, and their integration with visual device sensor, integration of the LEGACY terrain sysml model which can identify and import relevant physical parameters from available planetary databases, varying the speed of image output to the user by manipulating the gravity parameter, and integrating it with already developed terrain models. This device can be further used to feed real-Time physiological performance data to a separate sensor based system, and study the related effects on human subjects. VISR will be an effective tool which would equip the researchers, mission planners and space travelers for a future planetary manned mission.",Asteroids; Database systems; Fighter aircraft; Gravitation; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Image processing; Interplanetary spacecraft; Landforms; Liquid sloshing; Manned space flight; Physiology; Planets; Planning; Reconfigurable hardware; Robotics; Space stations; Spacecraft; Three dimensional computer graphics; Training aircraft; Virtual reality; Visualization; Extravehicular activity; High performance computing; Human Machine Interface; Interactive 3d visualizations; Interactive Environments; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; University of North Dakota; Virtual reality modeling; Behavioral research,,"International Astronautical Federation, IAF",Conference paper,Scopus,,1,,,,,,

Qamar A.; Wikander J.; During C.,Managing dependencies in mechatronic design: a case study on dependency management between mechanical design and system design,2015,Engineering with Computers,11,"In this paper, we have investigated the role of dependencies in the design process of mechatronic products. Since explicit modeling of dependencies is largely considered unnecessary today, current languages do not support dependency modeling due to lack of sufficiently expressive language constructs. However, this paper argues that modeling dependencies is important in managing the overall design process. The paper highlights dependencies between two important viewpoints: system design and mechanical design. We have looked closely at how mechanical design (supported by CAD tools) establishes a backbone for the overall design concept. Mechanical design cannot be isolated from other design activities, and the mismanagement of dependencies there leads to problems in other domains too. To illustrate the process, the paper presents an example of modeling dependencies between system hierarchy in OMG SysML? and the CAD assembly in Solid Edge for a mechatronic design example. The paper presents two different approaches to capturing dependencies〞using a general purpose modeling language such as SysML and using a domain specific modeling language (DSML). We argue for using a DSML instead of a general purpose language and provide a DSML called the dependency modeling language (DML). An example DML model for a two degree of freedom robot use case is discussed. The paper also illustrates the complete process of capturing dependencies in a general purpose modeling language like SysML, which served as a good exercise on how to fetch data from a CAD tool and how to represent dependencies inside a significantly different modeling language. Lessons learned from doing this were applied to the construction of DML. Our aim for the future is to reduce the human effort required to build dependency models. Machine learning techniques and automated model transformations are valuable techniques to support this cause. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag London.",Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Design; High level languages; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Product design; Specification languages; Systems analysis; Automated model transformations; Domain specific modeling languages; DSML; General purpose modeling languages; Machine learning techniques; Mechatronic design; Model transformation; SysML; Computer aided design,,Springer-Verlag London Ltd,Article,Scopus,,,,,,1,,

Marko N.; Leitner A.; Herbst B.; Wallner A.,Combining Xtext and OSLC for Integrated Model-Based Requirements Engineering,2015,"Proceedings - 41st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2015",14,"Requirements engineering is still a very challenging issue. This is true for most embedded systems and especially for safety-critical ones. A good requirements engineering process is vital for the development of high quality products, but these systems are often highly complex which complicates the respective activities. The use of natural language requirements is common practice, because they are easy to use and understand for people working in different engineering disciplines. However, natural language is ambiguous and vague and may lead to misunderstandings and incorrect implementations. Another big challenge is the often loose coupling of requirements and other development artifacts which hinders traceability and thus impact analysis. This paper presents an approach based on the Xtext framework for the implementation of a restricted requirements language to support engineers in writing requirements with higher quality. In order to improve tool integration, the approach supports OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration), which is a promising method to better support traceability using linked data principles. By using OSLC it is possible to easily extend existing requirements management tools with our proposed implementation for requirements semi-formalization as long as requirements management tools provide the respective OSLC interface. Finally, we will demonstrate our concepts using an example from the automotive domain. The example shows how the tool implementation can be integrated in a tool chain. ? 2015 IEEE.",Application programs; Computational linguistics; Embedded systems; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Eclipse; Model-based engineering; OSLC; Requirements specifications; Semi-formal Requirements; Xtext; Requirements engineering,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,

Madni A.M.,Expanding stakeholder participation in upfront system engineering through storytelling in virtual worlds,2015,Systems Engineering,37,"Over the last decade, systems engineers have successfully created system modeling languages to communicate with other systems engineers. However, the ability to communicate an evolving system concept and design with stakeholders who are nonengineers remains an elusive goal. In large part, this inability stems from the latter having to understand complex diagrams and equations, and learn new notations employed by systems modeling languages. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that systems today have to frequently adapt to changing operational and regulatory requirements. Thus, to effectively communicate concepts of operation (CONOPS) and evolving system design to those outside the engineering discipline requires a different approach. This paper presents an innovative approach that employs technical storytelling methods to contextualize and map systems engineering (SE) artifacts represented in SysML to virtual worlds within which various storylines can play out. This capability is intended to improve comprehensibility and transparency of CONOPS and system designs when it comes to communicating with the broader stakeholder community. At the heart of this approach is a virtual world enabled by a 3D game engine, and a mapping capability that allows translation of SE artifacts and interdependencies to virtual world entities and interactions. The key idea behind this integrated capability is to allow the broader stakeholder community to collaborate effectively on key decisions during upfront SE. The benefits of this approach are greater stakeholder satisfaction, avoidance of rework, and more responsive system design. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Design; Interactive computer graphics; Systems engineering; Virtual reality; Engineering disciplines; Model-based systems engineering; Stakeholder participation; Stakeholder satisfactions; Storytelling; System modeling languages; Systems modeling languages; Virtual worlds; Systems analysis,,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,Article,Scopus,,,,,,,,

The drive from both domains is for more functionality and efficiency from vehicles. The resultant effect on system development means the complexity of the designs has increased and thus the complexity of the virtual simulations used for test and analysis has also increased. When actual systems or their components are integrated with the simulation environment, live-virtual testing places real-time demands on the testing of the architecture and environment. This paper describes a proposed innovative approach, derived from aerospace engineering, where the vehicle requirements are allocated to relations between the elements in the architecture and not just to system elements. An approach to using the relational oriented modelling structure for test and analysis is also described. The requirements and system architecture models specified using relational orientation are therefore seen to provide an early demonstration of a rigorous new approach to system of systems design, test and analysis that uses requirements trace ability at the architecture level. This approach promises to bring better trace ability of system requirements to the simulation of vehicle behaviour in general and to real time behaviour in particular. ? 2014 IEEE.",Amphibious vehicles; Architecture; Distributed computer systems; Integration; Models; Real time systems; Software architecture; Software design; System of systems; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Vehicles; Virtual reality; environments; frameworks; MBSE; Model driven architectures; Relational orientations; Requirement traceabilitys; System architectures; Computer architecture,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,1,,,,

Compliance requirements management, in this context, may become particularly challenging. Partners in the network may join and leave the collaboration dynamically and tasks over which compliance requirements are specified may be consequently delegated to new partners or back sourced by network participants. This paper considers the issue of aligning the compliance requirements in a BN with the monitoring requirements they induce on the BN participants when change (or evolution) occurs. We first provide a conceptual model of BNs and their compliance requirements, introducing the concept of monitoring capabilities induced by compliance requirements. Then, we present a set of mechanisms to ensure consistency between the monitoring and compliance requirements when BNs evolve, e.g. tasks are delegated or back sourced in-house. Eventually, we discuss a prototype implementation of our framework, which also implements a set of metrics to check the status of a BN in respect of compliance monitor ability. ?

Madni A.M.; Nance M.; Richey M.; Hubbard W.; Hanneman L.,Toward an experiential design language: Augmenting Model-Based Systems Engineering with technical storytelling in virtual worlds,2014,Procedia Computer Science,19,"Systems engineering has made significant strides over the last decade with the advent of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and the Systems Engineering Markup Language (SysML). These advances have made it possible for collaborative engineering teams to communicate using a common language and share information in the form of digital models rather than hard-to-maintain paper documents. One major advance that needs to occur next is enhancing systems engineering languages to address the needs of all stakeholders especially non-engineers. In this paper, we advance the proposition that recent advances in systems modeling, virtual world building, and technical storytelling are the key enablers of next generation systems engineering and systems engineering languages. To this end, this paper presents an innovative approach for developing an experiential design language that augments existing systems engineering language (i.e., SysML) with new perspectives informed by exploration and storytelling in virtual worlds. This language is intended to allow all stakeholders to understand and collaborate on system designs without having to learn engineering notation, and bring to bear their unique perspectives during collaborative system design. Furthermore, immersive experiences made possible by storytelling in the virtual world can potentially illuminate key system interactions and behaviors, allowing all stakholders to make meaningful contibuions in upfront systems engineering. The benefits an payofs of the experimental design language are increased participation of all stakeholders in upfront systems engineering; supeior collaboration among stakeholders by allowing them to focus on different system levels and perspectives; and elegent system design by getting the architecture right the first time minimum structural complexity. ? 2014 The Authors.

Knauss E.; Ott D.,Semi- automatic categorization of natural language requirements,2014,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12,"Context and motivation: Requirements of todays industry specifications need to be categorized for multiple reasons, including analysis of certain requirement types (like non-functional requirements) and identification of dependencies among requirements.This is a pre-requisite for effective communication and prioritization of requirements in industry-size specifications. Question/problem: Because of the size and complexity of these specifications, categorization tasks must be specifically supported in order to minimize manual efforts and to ensure a high classification accuracy. Approaches that make use of (supervised) automatic classification algorithms have to deal with the problem to provide enough training data with excellent quality. Principal ideas/results: In this paper, we discuss the requirements engineering team and their requirements management tool as a socio-technical system that allows consistent classification of requirements with a focus on organizational learning. We compare a manual, a semi-automatic, and a fully-automatic approach for the classification of requirements in this environment. We evaluate performance of these approaches by measuring effort and accuracy of automatic classification recommendations and combined performance of user and tool, and capturing the opinion of the expert-participants in a questionnaire. Our results show that a semiautomatic approach is most promising, as it offers the best ratio of quality and effort and the best learning performance. Contribution: Our contribution is the definition of a socio-technical system for requirements classification and its evaluation in an industrial setting at Mercedes-Benz with a team of ten practitioners. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Automation; Classification (of information); Computer software selection and evaluation; Industry; Natural language processing systems; Specifications; Tools; Automatic classification; categorization; Natural language requirements; Natural languages; Non-functional requirements; requirements; Requirements classifications; Requirements management tool; Requirements engineering,,Springer Verlag,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,

It does not follow the procedure as followed in the conventional programming by a developer. In this paper basic introduction of expert systems consisting of their composition, basic characteristics and advantages of expert systems are covered. Apart from this, considering the development process of expert systems, it's not as easy to develop successful expert systems as it seems. There are certain factors which can lead to failure of expert systems and among them requirement engineering for expert systems is the one. While developing expert systems developers pay least attention to the requirement engineering process. Instead requirement engineering is very crucial to gather all the requirements that are needed for an expert system. If the requirements do not fulfill all of the client's wishes and needs, then in that case expert system is considered fail even though it works perfectly. Therefore, for successful development of expert systems its necessary that emphasize on requirement engineering process of expert systems should be laid down.

Prun D.,1.3.3 Extending eFFBD formalism to task model,2014,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"In this paper, we study how eFFBD formalism can be modified to encompass task modeling. eFFBD is a formalism widely used by System Engineering community to model complex systems through a functional point of view. Task models are used by Human Factor community to express and analyze human activities. Although they appear to be complementary, functional modeling and task modeling are rarely used jointly. This separation contributes to reinforce barriers between disciplines and leads to inefficient system engineering processes. In order to improve this situation, we decided to extend eFFBD formalism to encompass task model expressivity. Based on eFFBD and task models comparison, we identify the need to add 3 new operators to eFFBD: suspend, resume and disable. Then we propose definition of a syntax and a formal semantic for these new operators. Our proposal is illustrated through the presentation of LEXE: an experimental tool supporting modeling and simulation of eFFBD, and its application on a concrete case.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Grady J.,5.2.1 How Does A System Engineer Really Identify Interface Needs?,2014,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The author has not observed in the literature a description of an organized systematic method for identifying a need for an interface during system development on a program. Most system engineers tend to do this using experience as the early product concept design work matures and they think of it as an obvious activity. The author reached this conclusion by conducting a survey of very experienced system engineers over a period of three INCOSE IS in past years. This paper offers an alternative that is organized with clear instructions on how to accomplish the work. One could argue that it could require considerable time to accomplish in an exhaustive fashion because it involves a possibly large number of evaluations of pairs of trios of information. So, there is an up side that the method does exhaustively evaluate all possible interface needs but the method also has a down side that may involve an increase in cost during the learning curve and even thereafter. One can choose to apply the intuitive process often applied today, switch to the systematic method described in this paper, or selectively apply the systematic method where new technologies and concepts are involved.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,

(Jenkins, 1969). This paper documents research that reviewed three existing models for managing the complexity of the system development process in the INCOSE literature and found that while these models drew different systems of interest (SOI) from different perspectives they were unable to manage complexity in any practical manner. This paper then presents a Nine-System Model that can be used to manage complexity. This Nine-System Model builds in best practices and, being self-similar, can be applied in any level of the systems hierarchy. The nine systems in the model comprise situations, processes and socio-technical systems in a clearly defined interdependent manner. The application of the Nine-System Model is illustrated in two examples. The paper then compares the four different models, and uses the Nine-System Model as a framework to relate the MIL-STD-499 (MIL-STD-499A, 1974), EIA 632 (EIA 632, 1994), IEEE 1220 (IEEE 1220, 1998) and the ISO/IEC 15288 (Arnold, 2002) Standards, the SIMILAR process (Bahill and Gissing, 1998), Hitchins' version of systems engineering (Hitchins, 2007) and the problem-solving process and shows that each is a subset of the Nine-System Model.

MBSE formalises the practice of systems engineering through the use of models and its aim is to overcome the limitations inherent in describing complex systems and their development and sustainment using documents. However, certain project practices, in particular the tendering and contracting processes, are still strongly tied to the use of documents. This paper identifies the challenges that need to be addressed to use MBSE across the contractual interface in a competitive tendering environment. The focus is on the transition of models created by the customer (acquirer) during the capability definition phase to the supplier both during the tendering process and through the systems architectural design and development phases. The paper unfolds with a literature survey and then progresses to surface key insights and challenges for the adoption of model-centric acquisition, looking into the past, present and future from the Australian and Norwegian defence perspectives. This is supplemented through case studies involving the utilisation of RDD-100 for model-centric acquisition of Frigates by the Royal Norwegian Navy and through ongoing research by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and the Defence and Systems Innovation Centre.

"Alvarez-Rodr赤guez J., Llorens J., Alejandres M., Fuentes J.",9.4.1 Why avoiding how when defining what? Towards an OSLC-based approach to support Model-Driven Requirements Engineering,2014,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The present paper debates the concept of requirement in the contexts of software and systems engineering. Requirements are usually extracted from documents, stakeholders and existing systems generating a natural language specification. On the other hand system models are designed to define system behavior and to validate and verify the system against a specification. That is why requirements, as a basic unit of specification, must be aligned and linked to a model with the aim of supporting the whole development lifecycle of any product or service. Although some Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodologies have tried to bridge the gap between natural language and models moving from document-centric to model or requirement-based approaches, there is still a lack of interoperability and integration between requirements and models that prevent a proper (re) use of requirements in the whole lifecycle. Furthermore this situation is becoming a major challenge in critical systems since a complete verification and validation must be ensured. In this light the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative pursues the creation of specifications to unify under a common and shared data model (the Resource Description Framework-RDF) all pieces of information and data involved in the development of a system. This initiative applies the principles of Semantic Web and the Linked Data initiative to provide a web standards-based environment for systems development. More specifically, OSLC defines the Requirements Management specification to deliver a common environment for managing and exchanging requirements. In this sense the on-going work implementing this specification and an example of modeling a controlled vocabulary for requirements management under the principles of the Linked Data and OSLC specifications is provided to demonstrate the capabilities and intentions of both initiatives. Finally some discussion, conclusions and future directions are also presented.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,

This task is commonly referred to as requirements prioritization. This paper describes a requirements prioritization method called Case-Based Ranking (CBRank), which combines project's stakeholders preferences with requirements ordering approximations computed through machine learning techniques, bringing promising advantages. First, the human effort to input preference information can be reduced, while preserving the accuracy of the final ranking estimates. Second, domain knowledge encoded as partial order relations defined over the requirement attributes can be exploited, thus supporting an adaptive elicitation process. The techniques CBRank rests on and the associated prioritization process are detailed. Empirical evaluations of properties of CBRank are performed on simulated data and compared with a state-of-the-art prioritization method, providing evidence of the method ability to support the management of the tradeoff between elicitation effort and ranking accuracy and to exploit domain knowledge. A case study on a real software project complements these experimental measurements. Finally, a positioning of CBRank with respect to state-of-the-art requirements prioritization methods is proposed, together with a discussion of benefits and limits of the method. ? 1976-2012 IEEE.",Knowledge management; Requirements engineering; Experimental measurements; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Partial order relation; Preference information; Prioritization process; Requirements management; Requirements prioritization; Learning systems,"A.

Sousa A.R.; Tavares J.J.P.Z.S.,Toward automated planning algorithms applied to production and logistics,2013,IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline),9,"In recent years several studies have been made showing artificial intelligence techniques as enhancement proposals for real practical systems. One of such approaches is automated planning, in which knowledge of the system's behavior, expressed through a model, is used by a piece of software denominated automated planner to infer a sequence of actions capable of bringing the system from some initial state to an objective, a so called plan. To do such, the planner relies on some search algorithm capable of exploring the possibilities exposed by the model, and several different approaches have been used by different planners with varying degrees of success. This paper presents an insight on some of the most consolidated ones, both regarding deterministic and probabilistic domains, and focuses on search techniques and generic heuristics in order to assist the development of new algorithms focused on production and logistics. It also covers the main formal system modeling languages, such as STRIPS, PDDL and PPDDL, used by such planners. ?

The work in [1] proposed a formalization of SysML state machine diagrams in which the diagrams were translated into CSP# processes that could be verified by the state-of-the-art model checker PAT. In this paper, we make several modifications and add new rules to the translation described in that work. First, we modify three translation rules, which we think are inappropriately defined according to the SysML definition of state machine diagrams. Next, we add new translation rules for two components of the diagrams - junction and choice pseudostates - which have not been dealt with previously. As the contribution of this work, we can achieve more reasonable verification results for more general SysML state machine diagrams. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial intelligence; Computer science; CSP; Formal Semantics; Model checker; Pseudo-states; State machine diagrams; Translation rules; Two-component; Verification results; Model checking,,,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,

A case study is used to apply the UPOEM to verify the practical implementation in a real project and from which a comparative experimental study and questionnaire survey were conducted. The findings indicate that the UPOEM can help generate more suggestions for improving design solution during designer-client communication compared with traditional approach.

Graves H.,8.5.2 Structural Modeling in Biomedical and Product Engineering,2013,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Structural modeling is common for biomedical systems as well as manufactured products. Examples and experience from both fields clarify modeling issues applicable to each field. Modeling in both fields shares the commonality that a model describes one or more physical, or virtual, structures in terms of their components and connections between components. Modeling effectiveness depends on the relationship between the model and the systems which realize or conform to the model. The logic based approaches used for biomedical modeling can be adapted for engineering with the promise that automated reasoning can be integrated into product development and maintenance. Modeling languages such as SysML provide good graphical syntax and the concepts needed for representing product decompositions and interconnections in multiple domains. This paper illustrates the benefits of working within a logic-based framework which incorporates the concepts of part decompositions and interconnections found in SysML. The concept of a model as an axiom set used in conceptual modeling languages such as OWL 2 is applied to SysML models.

"Schaus V., Fischer P., Gerndt A.","Taking Advantage of the Model: Application of the Quantity, Units, Dimension, and Values Standard in Concurrent Spacecraft Engineering",2013,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Designing a spacecraft involves many experts from different domains. In the early design phases they are brought together to discuss the spacecraft in a short period of time. The elements and building blocks the individual engineers want to use are stored and described in a shared system model provided by a software framework. A lot of features like the masses or dimensions are described using parameters. Due to the various domains and individual preference, many different units are used, leading to mistakes, distraction and misunderstandings caused by unit conversions. Our paper describes a pragmatic approach how the QUDV is integrated into an existing system model. This allows taking advantage of it by automatically analyzing the unit consistency as well as performing automatic conversions. The presented work shows that with a profound integration into the existing software framework, the engineers can overcome the error-prone task of unit checks and conversion problems.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Exchange of information between different software tools is of major interest for modern manufacturing industries from early design to final implementation. SysML, with its structure as a common platform, can then be interfaced with other domain-specific modeling tools to achieve information exchange. This paper presents a method to interface SysML with a recently introduced language for operation sequences called Sequence Planner Language (SPL). By this method, necessary information from behavioral constructs of SysML model are extracted and structured in SPL. This language, being a formal, graphical language, can be used to formally verify the system for any blocking states.

Firstly, the research team gathered a number of research-oriented SE taxonomies and compared and contrasted these with a SoSE capabilities framework that was an outcome from earlier research. This resulted in a new synthesis that was then evaluated for coverage against a set of SE research agendas. The evaluation informed further refinements that reorganised some of the categories and broadened the elements of SE capability somewhat.

Our design approach is based on the use of an architectural design framework and of optimization models, illustrated by a practical example in which the system of interest is a commercial electric vehicle in its ecosystem. We rely on systems engineering in order to clearly understand the system we want to study and its environment, during the entire life cycle of the system. For interdependent decisions between stakeholders in the lifecycle of the system, the concept of equilibrium is important. Architectural equilibrium of the system guarantees its integration in its environment, the stability of the environment and the satisfaction of all stakeholders. This is modeled as a game in the sense of game theory leading to a Nash equilibrium, which allows anticipating for changes in an uncertain environment (departure of a stakeholder, arrival of a new actor, changes in requirements or constraints and so on).",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,1,,,

"Hause M., Kihlstrom L.",2.5.2 Architecting in the Fourth Dimension Temporal Aspects of DoDAF,2013,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"The capture of system structure, behavior, configuration, interaction, and compliance is common practice in architectures. These are largely static views showing a specific configuration or behavior. IEEE Std 610.12?1990 defines architecture as ?the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.? (IEEE, 1990) Modeling this evolution or the temporal aspects in architecture frameworks such as the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) was previously problematic. With the release of DoDAF version 2.0, architectures can now take the fourth dimension (Time) into account. The challenge is to identify areas of architecture where time can be modeled and how to take best advantage of it. Also problematic is how to express these concepts without having to expose all the internal ontological relationships upon which DoDAF is built. The Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM) delivers an implementation of DoDAF 2.0 that provides a clear and concise way of expressing these concepts without requiring the user to become an expert in the DoDAF 2.0 ?internal wiring? and detailed ontological concepts.

Blahu?iak M.; Schlosser ?.; Cvengro? J.,Simulation of a new regeneration process of solvents with ionic liquid by short-path distillation,2012,Separation and Purification Technology,24,"A new promising process for the regeneration of solvents with ionic liquid (IL) by short-path distillation (SPD) has been proposed and its application potential analyzed by simulation. Main advantage of this process compared to classical stripping with alkali solution is that the product is in form of free acid, not its salt and the consumption of chemicals is reduced. The model loaded solvent with phosphonium IL from membrane based solvent extraction (MBSE) of butyric acid (BA) was regenerated by two stage SPD at the temperature of 130 and 160 ∼C and pressure of 13 and 2 kPa, respectively. SPD was combined with extraction of BA from the dodecane phase of distillates by water. Yield of BA in distillates was 89%. The concentration factors of BA in both concentrates compared to BA concentration in the fermentation broth were of 25 and 43, respectively, for the dodecane content in the dry solvent containing 70 mass% of IL. Overall theoretical heat consumption in SPD was 3410 kJ per kg of recovered BA. The simulation has shown that both the yield of BA in MBSE and the mass flux of the solvent in MBSE are strongly influenced by the residual content of BA in recycled dodecane after the extraction of BA. Both parameters play a key role in the process performance. Additional experimental data on MBSE, SPD and dodecane extraction are needed for design and optimization of the hybrid process. ? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The difficulty regarding to requirements traceability makes the system changes hard to be managed. Objective: This paper presents two approaches that allow the automated generation of the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM): the RTM-E approach, which is based on the requirement input data, and the RTM-NLP approach, which is based on Natural Language Processing-NLP. Method: The RTM-E comprises the requirements dependency related to the data manipulated by them, while the RTM-NLP comprises the requirements dependency related to the similarities of their functionality descriptions. The results are shown through visualization of information in order to facilitate the understanding of such dependencies. Results: We conducted an experimental study in which both approaches were applied to 18 requirements documents. The RTMs created automatically were compared with the reference RTM created manually based on the stakeholders knowledge. Comparing the generated matrices, it was seen that the RTM-E on average matches 82% to the reference RTM, while the RTM-NLP approach on average matches 53%. Conclusions: The results show that generating the RTM based on these approaches, the effectiveness on determining the requirements dependences is satisfactory and motivates to keep studying in order to make improvements for both approaches. ? 2012 IEEE.",Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Visualization; Automated generation; Automatic Generation; Experimental studies; Input datas; Natural languages; Requirements document; Requirements management; Requirements traceability; Requirements traceability matrix; System change; System failures; Visualization of information; Requirements engineering,"A.

The C/S Effectiveness can be evaluated through algorithms based on a combination of the Integrated Functional Breakdown (IFB) and an FMECA approach at C/S level. ? 2012 IEEE.,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Decision support systems; Integrated control; Decision-making algorithms; Effectiveness evaluation; Integrated logistics; Key performance indicators; Model-based systems engineering; Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Operational concepts; System effectiveness; Systems engineering,,,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,1,,
Park H.S.; Ko W.I.; Kim H.D.; Kim E.H.; Kim J.I.,A framework of the requirements for the management of a nuclear fuel cycle facility,2012,Progress in Nuclear Energy,3,"This study introduces a system that can confirm whether all requirements are satisfied, by systematically managing from the highest design requirements to the requirements for the lowest unit devices of the PRIDE facility through mutual relationships, and effectively traces the influences of the requirement changes. To carry out the technology traceability based on pyroprocess facility design data and research data, we need a database system that can manage an extensive amount of data. This paper explains the procedure of developing a pyroprocess system engineering framework and data schema established for this. To confirm whether the technology traceability is carried out within a reliable boundary based on the top requirements, system requirements, sub system requirements, and component requirements of the derived PRIDE system, an experiment was done with an Ar (Argon) cooling system as a target. As a result of verifying the validity of the technology traceability with the sample data input, it was confirmed that, when pyroprocess separation is designed in an Inert (Ar) gas atmosphere, from the top requirements of the pyroprocess, to the capacity and electricity of the Chiller unit, which is the unit process device composed of an Ar cooling system, and down to the requirements for the type, can be effectively traced. ? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In living ecosystems, innovation adapts to changes by predators, prey, and the rest of the environment (e.g., geology). For engineered systems, innovation exploits market interests in new capabilities, creates new markets, develops competitive advantage, and adapts to changes in technologies, infrastructure, regulations, and commercial environment. In all these domains, the process of innovation may itself be described as a system?the System of Innovation, and studied by natural scientists, engineers, and technologists. The relative effectiveness of different systems of innovation impacts the competitive viability of the resulting series of innovated systems.

Indeed, eFFBD is a modeling language focusing on functional paradigm i.e. allowing functional and behavioral modeling and reasoning about a system. Currently, it is often confronted or compared to other languages such as SysML for activity modeling (activity diagrams) based on object paradigm. This paper aims to demonstrate the interest and the potential advantages for systems designers, like most of the discipline-oriented designers to dispose of an enriched (conceptually and semantically) eFFBD modeling language called here xFFBD. This has to be a credible framework for modeling, communicating and reasoning about complex systems. After shortly recalling the history, the key concepts and capabilities of eFFBD, this paper compares eFFBD with other formalisms considered here as relevant for the study, Petri nets and SysML. Several leads are then identified and discussed in order to improve the eFFBD language and to provide a first draft version of xFFBD specification.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

"Nardini M., Ciambra F., Garzoli F., Croce D., Cao D., Basili R.",3.1.2 Machine Learning technologies for the Requirements Analysis in Complex Systems,2012,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Requirement Analysis is a relevant application area for a variety of Semantic Technologies related to the extraction, disambiguation and exploitation of the knowledge derived from technical requirement documents. Most methods rely on shallow language processing technologies for the automatic extraction of core concepts (e.g. components/devices, their parts and functionalities) and norms (e.g. constraints on the use of components). Few works have been devoted to study paraphrasing (i.e. textual equivalence between requirement definitions) for consistency checking and redundancy elimination. We propose here a distributional method to train a kernel-based learning algorithm (i.e. SVM), as a cost-effective approach to validate requirements from text in support of Requirement Analysis in the design of a Complex Systems, i.e. Naval Combat Systems. These latter are complex systems based on software components able to manage all the Combat System Equipment in different mission scenarios. We will describe the application of Recognition of Textual Entailment (RTE) techniques based on data-driven learning methods to this scenario. While modeling the asymmetric logical relation of entailment between two textual descriptions (i.e. an hypothesis and its thesis), RTE can be here applied to the validation step of compositions between system functionalities described in the requirement specification texts.

After identifying the cause of the contradictions the paper suggests one way to reconcile the camps is to dissolve the problem to distinguish between the activity known as systems engineering and the role of the systems engineer with a return to the old pre-NCOSE systems engineering paradigm.

The fulfillment of safety constraints is often only tested after the design of the systems, which leads to costly and time-consuming design iterations. The complexity of avionics systems is still managed through a number of predominantly manual, paper-based procedures. Relying on systems engineering and operations research methods and tools, a methodology was developed to support the design process. This methodology should reduce the design duration through an earlier consideration of safety constraints. It should also contribute to the overall improvement of the design, through an automated approach of its complexity. A generic meta-model is created, suitable for various kinds of avionics systems, which contains requirements - including safety requirements - and design goals. From these formal requirements and goals an algorithm creates corresponding mathematical constraints and optimization criteria. All valid architectures fulfilling these constraints are automatically generated.

The domain specific language was mapped to a metamodel of the Arena? discrete event simulation language, and the ATL? model transformation tool was used to automate the generation of the an instance of a simulation model from an instance of the electronics assembly system.

The paper then documents findings from research into the problem via the systems thinking perspectives and hypothesises that there are two requirements paradigms; the original A paradigm and the current B paradigm which is inherently flawed.

"Laporte C., Ptack K., Fanmuy G.",10.3.1 The Development of Systems Engineering International Standards and Support Tools for Very Small Enterprises,2012,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Industry recognizes that there are very small organizations that develop parts which contain software components. These organizations, those with up to 25 people, are very important to the world-wide economy, and the parts they develop are often integrated into products made by larger enterprises. Failure to deliver a quality product on time and within budget threatens the competitiveness of both organizations. One way to mitigate these risks is for all the suppliers in a product chain put in place proven engineering practices. Many international standards have been developed to capture such proven engineering practices. However, these standards were not written for very small development organizations and are consequently difficult to apply in such settings. An ISO Working Group has been established to address these difficulties. The working group developed standards and technical reports, ISO/IEC 29110, which were published in 2011 for organizations developing software. In 2009 an INCOSE working group was established to evaluate the possibility of developing a standard, using the ISO/IEC 29110 standard as a baseline and the ISO/IEC 15288 as the framework, for organizations developing systems. At the 2011 INCOSE International Workshop, a group of systems engineers reviewed the ISO/IEC 29110 software standard and proposed modifications to meet their needs. One constraint was to develop a document which will allow an organization developing systems with software components to be able to use the actual set of ISO/IEC 29110 standards as well as the proposed systems engineering standards. The future systems engineering standard is targeted at VSEs which do not have experience or expertise in tailoring ISO/IEC 15288. A draft document has been developed and reviewed. Recently, an ISO working group has been mandated to develop the ISO standard for very small organizations developing systems.

However, the conventional design approach, ?Document-Based Systems Engineering? (DBSE), is more and more reaching its limits. This research evaluates the benefits and the cost associated with the paradigm of ?Model Based Systems Engineering?

ACES is indeed deemed to be a suitable project for this study as it includes both a very complex ground segment as well as a challenging space segment on board the International Space Station. Following an introduction to SysML and the ACES mission, we first develop the metrics on which the cost-benefit analysis is based on. Then, we explain the methodology and models used to perform the analysis which targets to characterise DBSE versus MBSE based on the ACES ground segment development. Then, we use the Analytical Hierarchical Process to determine weighted criteria where attention is also given to the transitional process between DBSE and MBSE. After a critical reflection upon the analysis methodology and its results, we focus on lessons-learned from the use of SysML for the implementation of MBSE in space projects. We have identified five key areas of lessons-learned for using MBSE with SysML itself as well as main deficiencies for Enterprise Architect, the tool used to implement SysML.

Prior to this analysis, the physical and functional properties of the satellite system are encoded in a graph-based design language. During the automated design language compilation process several graph representations are generated. These graph representations are generated from the design constraints. From the mathematical analysis of the graphs three important interpretations can be derived. The first interpretation concerns the derivation of the exchange rates based on the analysis of the functional coupling. The second interpretation yields a feasible design sequence. Third, a generic backtracking method for resolving engineering design conflicts is presented and illustrated with an antenna example.

Graves H.,Integrating Reasoning with SysML,2012,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Most engineering tasks require in-depth reasoning. For some tasks, automated reasoning is feasible and can provide high leverage for solving difficult practical problems. Engineering questions can be represented as questions about a model, provided the model contains sufficient domain knowledge. The widely used UML family languages have been embedded within logics. By embedding a model as an axiom set within a suitable logic, engineering questions translate into questions about axiom sets. Automated reasoning can potentially be used to answer these questions. Examples of engineering questions that can be represented as logic questions include verification of a system capability (or a requirement satisfaction) and verification of whether a design change invalidates design constraints. By using this embedding engineers can use languages and tools that they are familiar with, have their models transparently translated into logic, automated inference applied, and the results be returned to their development environment. The logic embedding results of SysML, one of the UML family, is used to illustrate how engineering problems translate into logic problems and how the logic solutions translate back to engineering solutions. An engineering use case for air system capability analysis is used to show how a SysML model can be translated into an axiom set and the engineering question translates into a logic question and illustrates how formal reasoning about an axiom set can be used to answer the engineering question.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

To develop reusable software, robot system developers build module-based software on middleware platforms. However, since each module is built for a specific framework, it is difficult to apply modules to other systems. Therefore, it is of great importance to consider module design when module-based systems are developed. To design a software module, the modeling language acts as a good description and communication tool for simplification of the target system. In this paper, we introduce a module design for building module-based systems by using SysML as the modeling language. We also introduce an example system implemented on RT-Middleware, in which a mobile manipulator is used to grab a target object by using its vision capability. Since this example system was implemented by using the proposed design, it is easy to modify it and add functionality. ? 2011 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Computer software reusability; Middleware; Robots; Communication tools; Component based; Middleware platforms; Mobile manipulator; Modeling languages; Module design; Module-based; Pick-and-place; Reusable softwares; Robot system; Rt-middleware; Software modules; SysML; Target object; Target systems; Vision capability; Software design,"K.

Functional Digital Mock-Up (FunctionalDMU) is a combination of traditional DMU with behavioral simulation in mechatronics. Enhancing DMU with functional aspects, considerably more insight in product properties can be gained. To enable FunctionalDMU two main tasks have to be solved: a) simulators in the areas of mechanics, electronics, and software simulation have to talk to each other (coupling) and b) the simulation results have to be visualized in an interactive DMU environment. In this paper we present an independent and open approach to a FunctionalDMU framework including co-simulation. Starting with proprietary and natively given behavior and geometric models (in formats like JT), we wrap the behavior models into SysML to enable data exchange on an agreed and standardized format. The native behavior models still are executed in the corresponding simulators. The simulators are linked to the FunctionalDMU framework using a wrapping approach. Currently we support simulators such as Matlab/Simulink, Dymola, Saber, Rhapsody, SimPack, ANSYS with our framework. During simulation a simulator coupling algorithm controls the simulation processes. A dedicated visualization environment enables the user to interact with the simulation, i.e., to send simulation stimuli, change parameters, observe the simulation run etc. This paper introduces the components of the FunctionalDMU framework and illustrates the approach with an application example.

The system is composed of a 3D multi-axis movement peripheral and a software simulation system. The function and logic of each component are described. The proposed system allows user to ""examine"" and interact with a CGI fetus. The fetus visualization responds according to the movement of the peripheral. The system is designed systematically, so it can be modified or extended with ease. SysML is used as a main tool for designing the system.

Graves H.; Bijan Y.,Modeling structure in description logic,2011,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,0,"An overall goal of the INCOSE MBSE initiative is to provide SysML with a formal semantics and to integrate reasoning services as part of system engineering. UML class diagrams have been encoded as Knowledge Bases (KB) within the Description Logic (DL), ALCQI. The encoding provides a formal semantics for class diagrams which accords with the informal semantics. The encoding applies to SysML which is a profile of UML. The SysML block definition and internal block diagrams are not covered by the class diagram encoding. These diagrams are essential for representing composite structure such as manufactured products and molecular structures. The class diagram encoding is extended to composite structure diagrams in the DL ALCQIbid. A composite structure diagram describes structures in terms of part decompositions and connections between objects. A SysML composite structure diagram can be encoded in the language of OWL2, but is not an OWL2 axiom set, as the diagrams contain property equations which violate the regularity ordering constraints for complex property inclusions. Conditions are given for an ALCQIbid KB which are sufficient to encode a SysML composite structure diagram.

Increasing system complexity, reduction in available resources, globalized and competitive supply chains, and volatile market forces necessitate that a unified model-based systems engineering environment replace ad-hoc, document-centric and point-to-point environments in organizations developing complex systems. To address this challenge, we envision SLIM?a collaborative, model-based systems engineering workspace for realizing next-generation complex systems. SLIM uses SysML to represent the front-end conceptual abstraction of a system that can ?co-evolve? with the underlying fine-grained connections to models in discipline-specific tools and standards. With SLIM, system engineers can drive automated requirements verification, system simulations, trade studies and optimization, risk analyses, design reviews, system verification and validation, and other key systems engineering tasks from the earliest stages of development directly from the SysML-based system model. SLIM provides analysis tools that are independent of any systems engineering methodology, and integration tools that connect SysML with a wide variety of COTS and in-house design and simulation tools. We are presenting SLIM and its applications in two papers. In Part 1 (this paper), we present the motivation and challenges that led to SLIM. We describe the conceptual architecture (section 1) and use cases (section 2) of SLIM followed by tools available for production and evaluation usage (section 3).

Grady J.,4.5.1 Is System Engineering Overdue For a Fix?: INCOSE 2011 Symposium Paper 228,2011,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Like many of the readers of this paper the author has grown up with a concept for the development of new systems that has seemed appropriate and effective even though it has been difficult to observe it being accomplished perfectly in practice. Today many people with experience in the professions of systems engineering, program management, and system acquisition are beginning to question the effectiveness of our current concept of systems engineering where the system being developed is very complex involving the development of computer software entities and large scale information systems integrated into hardware entities that must perform on the far side of the possible. The motivation for the building concern appears to be dissatisfaction with the results of applying the current process on programs that involve very complex and difficult problems and the cost of those efforts. The author confesses to a degree of resistance to this critical attitude that was brought to the point of bubbling over for him when Aviation Week and Space Technology got into the act as it did in the November 1/8, 2010 issue. The author has been a devoted reader of the magazine for along time and will likely continue to be in the future but the article on systems engineering in this issue produced a bad attitude in him. However, he will try to overcome this reaction and discuss this attack on the profession of systems engineering from a serious perspective trying not to become too defensive. The intent in this paper is to uncover the central theme of the work of those in our profession, inquire if it is correct and effective as currently performed in part or whole, and, if not, to explore changes that can be made to answer the criticisms being offered. However, if we are to change the systems development concept radically, should we not first give that concept a fair defense.

This question is frequently asked when developing models. This is true whether developing Yourdon, IDEF0, UML, SysML, UPDM, or Lego models. The purpose of the model is to fulfill a need or to answer questions. Consequently, before starting the modeling exercise, one has to determine the questions that need to be answered and assessment criteria. Possibilities include requirements traceability, performance modeling, simulation, behavioral modeling, human factors, etc. Other factors will also affect the scope of the model. Does the model need to capture the complete development lifecycle or product lifecycle? This paper will first examine the concept of quality in general and as applied to modeling. Next we will look at the different reasons for modeling, and some of the corresponding characteristics of quality that can be applied to ensure that the model is of ?good quality?.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,

Grady J.,A Simple Prescription For Requirements Success,2011,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"In the development of systems and entities thereof it is extremely important as a prerequisite to design to know clearly what is needed, what are the essential characteristics that the design must have. We system engineers call these requirements and we prepare specifications for each entity in a system and for the whole system containing in each case all of the essential characteristics the design must possess. There are few enterprises and programs within them that are applying an effective requirements analysis approach but it is not all that difficult to do so. There are a few simple activities that can be combined to form a prescription for success. We should possess a preferred template for each kind of specification we will have to develop. We should model the program problem space and derive the requirements from model artifacts. Each paragraph of a specification should be linked to a model and a discipline provided by a particular engineering department of the developing enterprise such that on a program people from that department will apply that model to derive requirements that fall into that paragraph of program specifications. The model applied on all programs should be the same and it should be a comprehensive model meaning it is effective no matter how the design will be implemented in hardware, software, or people doing things. The modeling artifacts should be captured, reported, and configuration control applied to them. Finally, a program should establish and maintain traceability between the modeling artifacts and specification content using a requirements analysis sheet. This paper covers three comprehensive models, one of which an enterprise should select and apply on all programs. The paper also shows a preferred specification template and how to arrange traceability between the specification paragraphing structure, the modeling artifacts, and engineering department structure. In order to take advantage of this simple prescription an enterprise does have to apply effective management to initiate and continue movement from the present to a condition of success.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Yerushalmi R.; Felice R.A.,Implementing AUTOSAR atomic software components using UML/SYSML in C,2010,SAE Technical Papers,2,"The AUTOSAR standard is rapidly being adopted by automotive engineers for developing the software architecture and the firmware for automotive electronic control units (ECUs). AUTOSAR application consists of many components, two of which are; the software architecture that is a composition of AUTOSAR Atomic Software Components (AR A-S/W) and the behavior or implementation of each AR A-S/W. When such AR A-S/W implementation is specified using a modeling tool, it is referred to as AUTOSAR Behavioral Modeling. UML/SYSML is a widely used modeling language for specifying and designing software applications for aerospace, automotive, communications, consumer electronics, industrial controls and medical electronic systems and includes powerful behavioral modeling notations such as Statecharts and activity diagrams. In this paper we will quickly review the basic concepts that make up the AUTOSAR software architecture such as AUTOSAR Software Components and Software Composition, and the AUTOSAR Runtime Enviornment, then provide an in depth discussion of how we implement the behavior of an AUTOSAR S/W Component using UML/SYSML. This will include how to specify, design and generate implementation code using UML/SYSML while regarding the AUTOSAR Architecture. We will also show how this approach relates to the Internal Behavior sections defined in the AUTOSAR standard. Further we will explain how this approach can support reuse across domains, such that the user will be able to use the same UML/SYSML model to generate implementations for both AUTOSAR application or more traditional automotive environments.

The majority have already implemented an IT-based system, or, are testing and developing such systems. The level of detail of requirements depends on the stage of the program. Those approaching the license application have integrated all components of the repository concept, including the processes for the operational phase. Requirements management is closely associated with the quality management system. Combining requirement and decision-tracking has been expressed as an explicit goal for some programs. Caution was expressed regarding the expectations for the RMS being developed. There is a risk that such systems are perceived as expert systems that can derive decisions, which then will be unquestionably accepted.

Several authors have described this phase of Engineering Design. The Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) is one of these models. This study is based on the combined use of a modified version of Gero's FBS model and the latest developments of modeling languages for systems engineering. System Modeling Language (SysML) is a general-purpose graphical modeling language for specifying, analyzing, designing, and verifying complex systems. Our development shows how SysML types of diagrams match with our updated vision of the FBS model of conceptual design. The objective of this paper is to present the possibility to use artificial intelligence tools as members of the design team for supporting the synthesis process. The common point of expert systems developed during last decades for the synthesis of conceptual solutions is that their knowledge bases were application dependent. Latest research in the field of Ontology showed the possibility to build knowledge representations in a reusable and shareable manner This allows the construction of knowledge representation for engineering in a more generic manner and dynamic mapping of the ontology layers. We present here how processing on ontology allows the synthesis of conceptual solutions.

Graves H.,Logic for modeling product structure,2010,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,0,"A fragment of type theory with OWL class constructions for types and binary properties is used to formalize SysML Structural Block Diagram models. A structural SysML block diagram model is a model that does not have behavior in the sense that values of properties do not change. A structural model may include properties, variables and operations. Individuals are a special case of operators with no arguments. Type theory is chosen as the target semantic formalism as SysML constructions correspond closely to type theory term constructions. The type theoretic semantics defined in terms of introduction and elimination fits well with the informal SysML semantics. An abstract version of a structural model, called an Abstract Block Diagram (ABD), is introduced. An ABD is a theory closed under specific type, property, and operator constructions with additional axioms. The ABD corresponding to the SysML model contains axioms in the form of equations for types, and properties, and operators. This formalism captures the syntactic constructons of the SysML models and the type theoretic semantics appears to be in accord with the informal semantics, as documented in the OMG specification. ABD theory gives an explicit mechanism for introducing instances for types defined by property restrictions. This construction is useful for parts decompositions. ABD theory constructions have a limited kind of property union used to construct parts decompositions. An ABD determines a Description Logic (DL) closed under union, intersection, and existential type constructions and property constructions restricted by typing relations. The ABD constructions are useful in identifying potential extensions for SysML and may be useful, as well, for adding operator terms to Description Logic.",Formal languages; Model structures; Ontology; Semantics; Description logic; OWL; Product models; SysML; Type theory; UML; Data description,"H.

Rauniyar D.; Tanik U.J.,Integrated product development approach for cyber-physical systems utilizing standardized modeling languages and methodologies,2010,Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science,2,"Systems development has often resulted as a hit-or-miss proposition before the advent of standardized analysis and design languages providing blueprints understood by both software and systems engineers. This paved the way for modeling cyber-physical systems using established, yet evolving standardized notation widely accepted by industry. In the past, system analysts would try to assess the needs of their clients, generate a requirements analysis in some notation that the analyst understood (but not always the client), give that analysis to a programmer or team of programmers, and hope that the final product was the system the client wanted (Schmuller, 2003). However, advances in UML and SysML have created new pathways to the design process when combined with Concurrent Object Modeling and Architectural Design Method (COMET) methodology that can assist in the realm of complex embedded system design for next generation cyber-physical systems (Rajhans, 2009). In order for product development to meet a desired need, communicating the vision to the developers is of utmost importance. The UML is a visual modeling language that enables system builders to create blueprints that capture their design intentions in a standardized format for effective communication of engineering detail. The paper reviews some key benefits of using UML and SysML during the product development process with COMET. The UML process steps are briefly described, followed by an introduction to the SysML language which is an extension of the UML. The paper provides a process review of embedded system development using SysML for systems engineering that can be useful for modeling aspects of cyber-physical system development during integrated product development. Realizing the fact that SysML may be considered too generic to address embedded and real-time system design, the paper provides a brief review of COMET, a UML based method for the development of concurrent applications, in particular distributed and real-time applications (Gomaa, 2008). The Artificial Intelligence Design Framework introduced as part of the thesis work supported by NASA (Tanik, 2006) can be adapted to cyber-physical system design. The published book detailing the AIDF called Architecting Automated Design Systems is based on this thesis work (Tanik, 2008) and is being used as a basis for supporting cyber-physical system design using artificial intelligence decision support with many application areas, including complex safety-critical medical and space systems design. This journal paper establishes the link between the conference paper on integrated product development (Tanik, 2010), and the previous work on the PhD thesis completed in 2006 that relates to cyber-physical system design frameworks.",Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Blueprints; Decision support systems; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Models; NASA; Systems analysis; Architecture designs; COMET; cyber-physical system; Integrated product development; SysML; UML; Product development,,,Article,Scopus,,,,1,,,,

While this is not a trivial precondition, there are only a few reports on approaches to systematically and efficiently build domain ontologies, and these approaches are often highly biased towards their intended use. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper, we investigate an approach for building domain ontologies suitable for guiding requirements elicitation.

Weber R.H.,Addressing value-centric design as a multi-scale C2 problem,2010,AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2010,1,"The Complex Systems approach to science and engineering problems as pioneered at DOE National Laboratories and the Santa Fe Institute and now pursued broadly in academia provides the intellectual foundation for understanding how analysis of intentional and adaptive systems depends on computer simulation technology. Agent-oriented software can now generate virtual worlds where system analysts may conduct controlled laboratory experiments which overcome many limitations of both equation-based models and experiments with human subjects. The former lack the richness of dynamic interactions between opposing human controlled systems and the latter do not permit broad exploration of the trade-offs between capabilities of physical systems and operational concepts of human users, especially where the interactions may produce emergent outcomes. The argument is made that agent-based simulation provides the necessary tools for enabling a fruitful convergence of the Model-Based Systems Engineering and Value-Centric Design (VCD) movements to engage the multi-scale C2 design problem which is the crux of human operated Complex Systems. Reflexively, VCD should see itself as a multi-scale C2 problem as it addresses the communication gaps between various layers of engineering and military user communities, when and where those gaps bear major responsibility for the poor C2 performance of DoD system acquisition organizations in the system development process. ? 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",Experiments; Software agents; Virtual reality; Agent based simulation; Computer simulation technology; Controlled laboratories; Equation-based models; Model-based systems engineering; Operational concepts; Science and engineering; System development process; Design,,,Conference paper,Scopus,,,,,,,,1

"Ferris T., Do Q.",4.2.3 The Impact of Understanding the Need and Available Products in COTS Selection,2010,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Nowadays, more and more engineering solutions are built by integrating Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) products rather than building subsystems from scratch. The selection of COTS for defence acquisition and upgraded projects presents a great challenge to systems engineers due to the rapidly changing nature of electronic systems, particularly those related to sensors, combat and mission systems, weapons and countermeasures, avionics, and communications. This paper explores the issues associated with the selection of COTS subsystems to be integrated into a larger system. When the total number of COTS components of the same kind to be procured is very low, such as one unit, there are additional constraints impacting the selection and procurement process. A case study is presented based on the development of the Systems Integration Sandpit (SIS) for exploring systems integration issues, fostering model-based systems engineering and systems engineering education.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Over the years, the Handbook has evolved to accommodate advances in the SE discipline and now serves as the basis for the Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP) exam. Due to its evolution, the Handbook had become somewhat disjointed in its treatment and presentation of SE topics and was not aligned with the latest version of International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 15288:2008, Systems and Software Engineering. As a result, numerous inconsistencies were identified that could confuse practitioners and directly impact the probability of success in passing the CSEP exam. Further, INCOSE leadership had previously submitted v3.1 of the Handbook to ISO/IEC for consideration as a Technical Report, but was told that the Handbook would have to be updated to conform with the terminology and structure of new ISO/IEC15288:2008, Systems and software engineering, prior to being considered. The revised INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook v3.2 aligns with the structure and principles of ISO/IEC 15288:2008 and presents the generic SE life-cycle process steps in their entirety, without duplication or redundancy, in a single location within the text. As such, the revised Handbook v3.2 serves as a comprehensive instructional and reference manual for effectively understanding SE processes and conducting SE and better serves certification candidates preparing for the CSEP exam.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,

The concepts found in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) such as parametrics, blocks, complex ports, enhanced activity modeling, and cross-cutting constructs improve the state of the art for systems engineers and architects. The formal meta-model basis of UPDM also provides a basis for trade-off analysis, model execution, requirements traceability, and the transition to systems development and implementation. Finally, the interconnections between views can help combat stovepipe development and improve communication.

LERAT J.,5.5.2 Three Reasons why Document-based SE (usually) works better than (most of) MBSE,2010,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Under this provocative title, this paper warns the reader against a common belief: MBSE is the key to success. This statement is not wrong but terribly reductionist since the success of MBSE requires good SE practices to begin with. However in real life, most of MBSE efforts are just reflecting the bad SE practices that it pretends to correct. This mirroring does not help to solve the problems nor to implement better SE practices. In general, it just bastardizes what was already hardly working, based on document exchanges. As a way to support this demonstration, the paper highlights a number of problems that, if not addressed, ruins any MBSE implementation. Successful implementation of MBSE is a crucial factor of survivability for most of companies and agencies in today's world. This silver-bullet is, in many cases, the last ammunition of the projet managers: that's why it is worth to pay a bit of attention to the target, before shooting.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,1,,,,

One of the challenges in modeling is to find appropriate representations that are understandable for relevant stakeholders and that contain sufficient information. In this paper, we discuss how to visualize space, time and process flow of systems, both internal as well as in their context. We argue that visualizations must connect to the stakeholders' world. We observe that architects tend to create abstract diagrams, alienating their stakeholders by abstraction, the use of jargon, and the presence of lots of (irrelevant) details.

"Kendell E., Jenkins S.",An Introduction to Knowledge Representation and Ontology Development for Systems Engineers,2010,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Effective communication requires a common vocabulary. An ontology provides a description of the terminology, concepts and relationships for a particular area of interest. An ontology may be viewed as a declarative encoding of the meaning of the domain vocabulary terms, thus making it a key to enabling communication. For systems that are used by people whose understanding of a domain is not necessarily consistent, an explicit description of the important terms can be extremely useful. Many commercial companies have successfully deployed applications with increasing use of semantics such as taxonomy-based search and navigation services. Rule-based manufacturing, product configuration, and financial services systems have been relatively common in those industries for many years. Fewer organizations have successfully deployed semantically rich systems that incorporate ontology-based metadata, sophisticated reasoning and explanation support. The technology has been around for decades, though its use for web-based applications is relatively recent, and it remains difficult for some people to understand, let alone use effectively. This tutorial provides an overview of the knowledge representation landscape and attempts to demystify some of the ?black art? of ontology development.

"Scukanec S., van Gaasbeek J.",A Day in the Life of a Verification Requirement,2010,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"One measure of the quality of a product requirement is that it be verifiable. Verifiability assessment is one of the exit criteria for the Systems Requirements Review and is necessary for requirement validity. Nomination of one or more verification methods (examination, analysis, demonstration or test) is often taken as the sole evidence of verifiability. A completed Verification Cross Reference Matrix is frequently considered as the final verifiability assessment and responsibility for the remainder of the verification effort is transferred to the test and evaluation and other implementing communities for completion. Lessons learned from many Programs have shown that a more robust application of systems engineering should include the requirements engineers (with detailed knowledge of product requirement intent) working with the verification implementing organizations as the best combination to define the verification requirements. Such definition should include statement of the verification objectives, success criteria and environment. Including this information in the ?Quality Assurance? section of the requirements document allows for buy-in by the customer well in advance of implementing the verification activities. This information is used by verification personnel to generate one or more verification plans and to develop the detailed verification program. Verification requirements are planned into verification events which are executed using the proper system elements and environments. These verification requirements are key to establishing long lead verification facilities, tools and laboratories. Early definition of these requirements helps prevent facility re-designs and verification re-plans that can cause expensive delays. Finally, verification data analysis is performed, and the information compiled into verification reports certifying system product requirements compliance. This robust verification approach will provide proof of requirements satisfaction, leading to systems that meet the customers' needs at a lower life-cycle cost. This paper is written to explore the value of well-crafted verification requirements developed early in the Program.

Graves H.,Representing product designs using a description graph extension to OWL 2,2009,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3,"Product development requires the ability to check design consistency, to verify design properties, and to answer questions about a design's possible implementations. These tasks require inference based on design knowledge. The inference depends on having a representation of the design that is sufficiently precise to capture the design's intended meaning. Description Logics are languages with a formal logical semantics that have been engineered for conceptual modeling. OWL 2 is a W3C standard based on Description Logic. For algorithms that use inference to be guaranteed to produce an answer to a question the design knowledge base must generate a decidable theory. While OWL 2 has a decidable formal semantics it does not provide the expressiveness needed to constrain the possible interpretations of a design to be the intuitively valid physical implementations. A Description Graph Extension to Description Logic can be used to enhance expressiveness and eliminate design models that do not reflect the intended meaning. In a Description Graph extension a product design is represented as a Graph-Extended Knowledge Base (GEKB). A GEKB contains an embedded a description graph, such as a SysML block diagram, which represents the structure of the design. To achieve a decidable theory a product design KB is restricted to represent a Product Line. A Product Line is a top level design with specific variants that refine the top level design. A Product Line KB is decidable and its models have the structure intended for implementations. GEKBs provide a method to integrate SysML into a DL language tailored for product development that has a formal semantics.",Birds; Formal languages; Inference engines; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Product design; Product development; Semantics; Conceptual model; Description logic; Graph-extended DL; OWL; Product structure; SysML; Data description,"H.

Graves H.,Integrating SysML and OWL,2009,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2,"To use OWL2 for modeling a system design one must be able to construct a Knowledge Base (KB) that can represent detailed information such as the number of occurrences of a part and interconnections between parts. SysML Block Diagrams (BD) have sufficient expressiveness to represent detailed designs. Suitably restricted SysML block diagrams can be translated into OWL2 to achieve the same result. A SysML graphical syntax can be used for the KBs which are characterized as designs. Block Diagrams have a natural model-theoretic semantic and this semantics is preserved by the translation into OWL2 for a restricted class of Block Diagrams. An implementation of a design is a parts description of the system being modeled. For a design, a KB-model will contain an implementation of the system, but may contain other entities. When additional constraints satisfied by a KB that represents a design then the KB serves as a template for the design implementations. Design KBs can be developed in engineering design tools and exported to OWL tools for analysis. This work yields a partial unification of SysML and OWL that is sufficient for modeling the structure of complex systems.",Birds; Data description; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Tools; Conceptual model; Description logic; Graph-Extended DL; OWL; Product modeling; SysML; UML; Design,"H.

Nikora A.P.; Balcom G.,Automated identification of LTL patterns in natural language requirements,2009,"Proceedings - International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE",38,"Analyzing requirements for consistency and checking them for correctness can require significant effort, particularly if they have not been maintained with a requirements management tool (e.g., DOORS) or specified in a machine-readable notation. By restricting the number of requirements being analyzed, fewer opportunities exist for introducing errors into the analysis. This can be accomplished by subsetting the requirements and analyzing one subset at a time. Previous work showed that simple natural language processing and machine learning techniques can be used to identify temporal requirements within a set of natural language requirements. This paper builds on that work by detailing our results in applying these techniques to a set of natural-language temporal requirements taken from a current JPL mission and determining whether a requirement is one of the most frequently occurring types of temporal requirements. The ability to distinguish between different LTL patterns in natural-language requirements raises the possibility of automating the transformation of natural-language temporal requirements into LTL expressions. This would allow automated consistency checking and tracing of naturallanguage temporal requirements. Since correctness properties are often specified as LTL expressions, this would also provide a set of correctness properties against which abstract models of the system could be verified. ? 2009 IEEE.",Computational linguistics; Computer software selection and evaluation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quality assurance; Requirements engineering; Abstract models; Automated identification; Consistency checking; Correctness properties; Language requirements; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; NAtural language processing; Natural language requirements; Requirements analysis; Requirements management tool; Software reliability,"A.

Christophe F.; Sell R.; Bernard A.; Coata里ea E.,OPAS: Ontology processing for assisted synthesis of conceptual design solutions,2009,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,10,"This article focuses on a key phase of the conceptual design, the synthesis of structural concepts of solution. Several authors have described this phase of Engineering Design. The Function- Behavior-Structure (FBS) is one of these models. This study is based on the combined use of a modified version of Gero's FBS model and the latest developments of modeling languages for systems engineering. System Modeling Language (SysML) is a general-purpose graphical modeling language for specifying, analyzing, designing, and verifying complex systems. Our development shows how SysML types of diagrams match with our updated vision of the FBS model of conceptual design. The objective of this paper is to present the possibility to use artificial intelligence tools as members of the design team for supporting the synthesis process. The common point of expert systems developed during last decades for the synthesis of conceptual solutions is that their knowledge bases were application dependent.,Latest research in the field of Ontology showed the possibility to build knowledge representations in a reusable and shareable manner. This allows the construction of knowledge representation for engineering in a more generic manner and dynamic mapping of the ontology layers. We present here how processing on ontology allows the synthesis of conceptual solutions.

"Mandutianu S., Moshir M., Donahue K., Laboratory J.",1.3.3 Conceptual Model for Space Mission Systems Design,2009,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Modelling tools and methodologies without concerns about human understanding may not be suitable for communicating with stakeholders, customers, or management. There are many factors that can increase understandability. Using a generic systems engineering modelling language certainly helps but is not always enough. The understandability of modelling can be improved by using better modelling techniques and strategies, which might be part of a coherent methodology with a deliberate emphasis on communicability. The paper describes the application of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to the design of a JPL mission using the Object Oriented System Engineering Method (OOSEM). Complementary formal modelling using the Web ontology language (OWL) has also been investigated. Using only traditional means, under increased demands on productivity and decreased resources, system integration may become high risk, and lifecycle support is expensive and may result in rapidly outdated components. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is showing promise as a solution to this problem in addition to and enhancing more traditional approaches. The space mission systems models represent sciences and technologies including astrophysics, physics, electronics, mechanisms, hardware and software. Representations of system architecture specification, requirements, evaluation of alternative architectures and trade studies, including static simulation of the performance are grouped into views that represent different stakeholder viewpoints. The human understandability of the resulting models and how the modeling process can increase communication and understandability has also been addressed and observations are reported.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Sillitto H.,6.2.4 On Systems Architects and Systems Architecting: some thoughts on explaining and improving the art and science of systems architecting,2009,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"ISO's process to adopt the IEEE 1471 standard on architecture descriptions has revealed of the order of 130 standards concerning or relating to architectures and architecting. Within the ?enterprise architecture? theme alone, different people use the term to refer to mean quite different things: the ?architecture of the enterprise as a system?; the enterprise context for the enterprise IT system; or the architecture of the enterprise IT system itself. A focus on tools and methods has led to confusion between the creative activity of ?architecting?, by which I mean making or exposing the key strategic decisions about the purpose, organisation, behaviour and critical design features of the system, and the analytical and descriptive activity of architecture modelling, which supports and captures the results of architecting. The INCOSE UK Architecture Working Group established a ?belief systems? methodology to explore and seek to reconcile the many conflicting views on architecting This paper expands on the views presented by the author at the IS08 Architecture panel session in an effort to identify and communicate a better understanding of the fundamental skills, principles, philosophy and approach underpinning effective systems architecting.

These techniques are incomplete and often consider safety late in the development cycle when the most significant design decisions have already been made. The lack of an integrated approach to perform safety-driven system development from the beginning of the system lifecycle hinders the ability to create safe space systems on time and within budget. To address this need, the authors have created an integrated methodology for safety-driven system development that combines four state-of-the-art techniques: 1) Intent Specification, a framework for organizing system development and operational information in a hierarchical structure; 2) the STAMP model of accident causation, a system-theoretic framework upon which to base more powerful safety engineering techniques; 3) STAMP-based Hazard Analysis (STPA); and 4) State Analysis, a model-based systems engineering approach. The iterative approach specified in the methodology employs State Analysis in the modeling of system behavior. STPA is used to identify system hazards and the constraints that must be enforced to mitigate these hazards. Finally, Intent Specification is used to document traceability of behavioral requirements and subject them to formal analysis using the SpecTRM-RL software package. In this paper the application of this methodology is demonstrated through the specification of a spacecraft high gain antenna pointing mechanism for a hypothetical outer planet exploration mission. ?2008 IEEE.",Antenna accessories; Chlorine compounds; Computer software; Hazards; Hierarchical systems; Industrial engineering; Planets; Software packages; Specifications; Systems engineering; Technology; Accident causation; Design decisions; Design methodologies; Development cycles; Driven systems; Engineering techniques; Formal analysis; Hazard analysis; Hierarchical structuring; High gain antenna; Integrated approach; Integrated methodology; Iterative approaches; Model-based systems engineering; On time; Operational information; Planet exploration; Requirements specifications; Safe space; Space systems; State analysis; System behaviors; System development; System hazards; System life-cycle; Safety engineering,"B.

Little is currently known about constructing an interoperable network of systems and the incorporation of known emergent behaviors. The purpose of this panel is to explore the methods and principles in developing an architecture including the emergent behavior. SoS displays a global complexity that cannot be adequately managed by hierarchical structures and central control; therefore, traditional systems engineering and management approaches are inadequate and insufficient for a SoS. The challenge is how to understand the initiation mechanisms of the emergent behaviors for a particular system architecture model so that the resident beneficial or harmful emergent behaviors can be enhanced or mitigated with selected changes in the current system architectural model. Is model-based the only feasible approach to develop the architecture model with emergent behavior? If this is the answer, what kind of modeling methodology? Should it be solely based on agent-based modeling? or combination of SysMl and agent-based? Is SysML ready to deal with emergent behavior? For a non-modeling consideration, can we plan for the beneficial or harmful emergent properties? How do we overcome development friction that is bound to arise when there are complex, independent, overlapping governances? We may need experiment with ?guided? emergence that help produce the desired SoS capabilities and behaviors. The customer requirements for systems-of-systems evolve over time. There may only be system-of-system modeling at the level of the government agency, who actually procures but does not build, and not at the level of contractors who build the next generation of technologies.

"Artery G., De Spain M., Griego R.",KR01 Product Life-Cycle Modeling Utilizing SysML Modeling,2008,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Functional modeling and SysML/UML are defined communication languages that engineers and related disciplines use to communicate the nature of engineering products. We often see functional modeling and SysML/UML used to describe large, physical entities, such as airplanes or space craft. Systems engineers use functional modeling to decompose these large systems into subsystems. Each subsystem has defined requirements, defined roles and responsibilities (functions), and definable interfaces. Each subsystem consists of electrical hardware, mechanical hardware, and computer software. Functional modeling and SysML/UML can also be used for modeling program/project management processes, systems engineering processes, and manufacturing processes. Many organizations use an array of flow charts, organization charts, network diagrams, and spreadsheets to define engineering processes. This paper presents how Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) used functional modeling and SysML/UML to define the design and development processes and procedures for a product realization process (PRP) called the Integrated Phase Gate (IPG) Process. The use of functional modeling helped the organization more readily accept the use of systematic modeling for developing PRP.

Conceptual agent-based modeling is discussed to illustrate possible modeling approaches for identifying and assessing emergent behaviors according to the emergent principles. The agent-based simulation will be the inputs to system-of-systems (SoS) architectural models. Neural network artificial intelligence may be needed to assist our understanding of the emergent behaviors during operations of SoS and the associated system architecture model development.

Each use case contains a sequence of steps which are described with a natural language.

Moreover, effectiveness of a review depends on quality of the submitted document - if a document contains many easy-to-detect defects, then reviewers tend to find those simple defects and they feel exempted from working hard to detect difficult defects.

"Piggott S., Melanson P., Hartman L.",1.3.2 A Vision for Super-Model Driven Systems Engineering,2007,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been developing for some time, and has recently acquired new impetus with the completion of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). This paper envisions taking MBSE much further, to a future of highly integrated and automated design and verification coupled with advances in simulation and domain linkage to allow the synthesis of complete systems from requirements into mathematical models and then into physical realizations. This would permit the application of three of the most successful approaches from agile software development, namely rapid, iterative development of the system starting with the highest value functions, facilitating continual reassessment of the future direction, and continual regression testing to ensure that system bugs are identified and removed rapidly. We envisage the requirements and the model evolving together from proto-requirements and proto-model in increasing detail until the point at which the model can be realized with real hardware and software. Taking this further, the MBSE engine can perform trade-offs and optimization on the design. Implementing this vision requires progress in a number of technologies, such as data exchange between domain tools. At this time, much engineering effort is consumed in people communicating and mediating information and translating it from one form to another (e.g. system design to mechanical design). If we can realize the vision proposed, we can remove much of the burden of information mediation and optimization, allowing engineers to focus on their expertise and larger issues.

Specifying the appropriate characteristics of the interface is therefore crucial to the correct implementation of the system. The goals of HCI are to develop or improve the safety, utility, effectiveness, efficiency, and usability of systems that include computers. The challenges for HCI are to keep abreast of technology, and to ensure that their designs offer good HCI, as well as harnessing the potential functionality of the new technology. As SysML becomes more prevalent for modeling systems, integrating HCI aspects into these models has the potential for improving HCI, eliminating duplication of tasks, and making systems more useable.

"Kaindl H., Griego R., Hause M., Hood C., Mannion M.",4.1.0 Panel 4.1.0: Requirements Engineering for Software vs. Systems in General?,2007,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Requirements Engineering is dealt with concurrently and largely separately by a software-based requirements engineering community anchored in the IEEE and by the INCOSE Requirements Working Group. Apart from such organizational issues, are there fundamental technical differences between Requirements Engineering for software vs. systems in general? It seems as though even functional requirements can mean something more general for a system including mechanical parts than for software alone. Quality requirements on safety deal with humans and their relationship with some real artifacts in their environment, so they cannot be dealt with by software alone. However, reliability of underlying software will be important in this context. While the internal structure of software will not normally be specified in its requirements, structure of a more general system may well be. These are just examples of what should be discussed. With regard to intelligent enterprises, there exist defined methodologies for enterprise modeling. Much as any other complex system, an enterprise may be better understood through modeling. Once an enterprise is better understood, it may be easier to make it intelligent. Whatever technical system is to be developed in an enterprise, it needs to fit into. By connecting enterprise modeling and requirements engineering, the likelihood of such a fit is increased. For software development, such connections have been worked out and are part of defined methodologies, some of them based on object-oriented modeling. Are they applicable to the development of general systems? The software-based requirements engineering community and the INCOSE Requirements Working Group have been slowly getting in touch with each other recently.

How does an organization ensure traceability from MAF artifacts and any subsequent Systems Engineering artifacts? In addition to heavyweight and lightweight mapping, SysML offers bridges that provide traceability between artifacts in MAF and any subsequent system specification. The concepts used by the different languages are examined as well as mapping from MAF to SysML. Then this paper explores allocation and requirements traceability.

Classical behavioural models cannot simulate TPPU beyond simple cases due to all the possible permutations in the job flow. SM models overcome this by storing the status of activities and products and then using them in the next time step as inputs to change the status through an action or an output.

It is a general-purpose graphical modeling language with computer-sensible semantics. This Part 1 paper and its Part 2 companion show how SysML supports simulation-based design (SBD) via tutorial-like examples. Our target audience is end users wanting to learn about SysML parametrics in general and its applications to engineering design and analysis in particular. We include background on the development of SysML parametrics that may also be useful for other stakeholders (e.g, vendors and researchers). In Part 1 we walk through models of simple objects that progressively introduce SysML parametrics concepts. To enhance understanding by comparison and contrast, we present corresponding models based on composable objects (COBs). The COB knowledge representation has provided a conceptual foundation for SysML parametrics, including executability and validation. We end with sample analysis building blocks (ABBs) from mechanics of materials showing how SysML captures engineering knowledge in a reusable form. Part 2 employs these ABBs in a high diversity mechanical example that integrates computer-aided design and engineering analysis (CAD/CAE). The object and constraint graph concepts embodied in SysML parametrics and COBs provide modular analysis capabilities based on multi-directional constraints. These concepts and capabilities provide a semantically rich way to organize and reuse the complex relations and properties that characterize SBD models. Representing relations as non-causal constraints, which generally accept any valid combination of inputs and outputs, enhances modeling flexibility and expressiveness.

Natt Och Dag J.; Thelin T.; Regnell B.,An experiment on linguistic tool support for consolidation of requirements from multiple sources in market-driven product development,2006,Empirical Software Engineering,30,"This paper presents an experiment with a linguistic support tool for consolidation of requirements sets. The experiment is designed based on the requirements management process at a large market-driven software development company that develops generic solutions to satisfy many different customers. New requirements and requests for information are continuously issued, which must be analyzed and responded to. The new requirements should first be consolidated with the old to avoid reanalysis of previously elicited requirements and to complement existing requirements with new information. In the presented experiment, a new open-source tool is evaluated in a laboratory setting. The tool uses linguistic engineering techniques to calculate similarities between requirements and presents a ranked list of suggested similar requirements, between which links may be assigned. It is hypothesized that the proposed technique for finding and linking similar requirements makes the consolidation more efficient. The results show that subjects that are given the support provided by the tool are significantly more efficient and more correct in consolidating two requirements sets, than are subjects that do not get the support. The results suggest that the proposed techniques may give valuable support and save time in an industrial requirements consolidation process. ?

"Engel A., Browning T.",2.1.2 Designing Systems for Adaptability by Means of Architecture Options,2006,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Systems provide value through their ability to fulfill stakeholders' needs and wants. These needs evolve over time and may diverge from a fielded system's capabilities. Thus, a system's value to its stakeholders diminishes over time. As a result, systems are replaced or upgraded at substantial cost and disruption. If a system is designed to be changed and upgraded easily, however, this adaptability adds to its lifetime value. How can adaptability be designed into systems so that they will provide maximum value to stakeholders throughout their lifetime? This paper describes the problem and an approach to its mitigation. We adopt the concept of real options from the field of economics and extend it to the field of systems architecture. We coin the term architecture options for this next-generation method and the associated tools for the design of flexible systems. Architecture options provide a quantitative means of implementing the optimal degree of design flexibility in a system to maximize its lifetime value for varied stakeholders. Based on initial research to date, we believe that implementing this aspect of design for adaptability can increase a system's overall stakeholder value by 15% at a very conservative minimum.

Instead, functional analysis teams performing work prescribed by the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) end up doing that ?heavy lifting? in the course of developing JCIDS functional area, needs and solutions analyses. Analysis teams performing JCIDS Functional Area Analysis (FAA) assess hundreds of activities listed in the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) for relevance to their functional domain. This paper does not intend to discount the importance of the review of the tasks and activities required in the FAA, yet it is highly desirable to utilize the precedent foundations provided by those functional area analysts who blazed the trail for predecessor systems currently operating within their operational domain. A systems engineering meta-model provides such a foundation for a living engineering model from operational needs analysis through production and deployment. The framework described below, the ?Big Navy? Meta-model, is an example of one pattern that can be applied to facilitate the development of complex defense-related systems. Systems models derived from Big Navy can be further refined over its life cycle to include requirements capture, functional analysis, architecture development, concept and engineering design and design validation which includes modeling and simulation.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

"Scott W., Kasser J., Tran X.",Improving the Structure and Content of the Requirement Statement,2006,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"This paper discusses the perennial problem of poor requirements and summarises an attempt to mitigate the problem using an object-oriented approach by developing and using a software tool named Tiger Pro. Next the early results of using Tiger Pro in the classroom are discussed. The major outcome was the transition of the classroom discussion from a focus on the structure of the requirement sentence to a focus on the difficulty of writing a good requirement, or a focus on the content of the requirement sentence. The paper then considers the distinction of structure and content of a requirement and the levels of examination. This can be shown to classify the attributes of a good requirement. The classification of the attributes of a good requirement reveals that the content of an individual requirement is the focus of examination, but requirement management tools focus on the structure of the requirement set. The paper concludes by proposing a structure to capture the information in a requirement that facilitates the writing of better requirements.",/,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Mason P.; Cosh K.; Vihakapirom P.,"On structuring formal, semi-formal and informal data to support traceability in systems engineering environments",2004,"International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings",1,"The development of large, complex systems poses a number of challenges for systems engineers, not least of which is the ability to ensure user requirements have been satisfied. Effective requirements management - an amalgam of information capture, information storage and management, and information dissemination activities - is crucial in that respect. In this paper we concentrate on one of the core issues of information management in a requirements management context - namely traceability. Traceability is the common term for mechanisms to record and navigate relationships between artifacts produced by development processes. However, realising effective traceability in systems engineering environments is complicated by the fact that engineers use a range of notations to describe complex systems. These range from natural language (informal), to graphical notations such as Statecharts (semi-formal) to languages with a well defined (formal) semantics such as VDM-SL and SPARK Ada. Most have tool support, although a lack of well-defined approaches to integration leads to inconsistencies and limits traceability between their respective data sets (internal models). This paper demonstrates an approach based on meta-modelling that enables traceability links to be established and consistency maintained between tools.

Spanoudakis G.; Zisman A.; P谷rez-Mi?ana E.; Krause P.,Rule-based generation of requirements traceability relations,2004,Journal of Systems and Software,177,"The support for traceability between requirement specifications has been recognised as an important task in the development life cycle of software systems. In this paper, we present a rule-based approach to support the automatic generation of traceability relations between documents which specify requirement statements and use cases (expressed in structured forms of natural language), and analysis object models for software systems. The generation of such relations is based on traceability rules of two different types. More specifically, we use requirement-to-object-model rules to trace the requirements and use case specification documents to an analysis object model, and inter-requirements traceability rules to trace requirement and use case specification documents to each other. By deploying such rules, our approach can generate four different types of traceability relations. To implement and demonstrate our approach, we have implemented a traceability prototype system. This system assumes requirement and use case specification documents and analysis object models represented in XML. It also uses traceability rules which are represented in an XML-based rule mark-up language that we have developed for this purpose. This XML-based representation framework makes it easier to deploy our prototype in settings characterised by the use of heterogeneous software engineering and requirements management tools. The developed prototype has been used in a series of experiments that we have conducted to evaluate our approach. The results of these experiments have provided encouraging initial evidence about the plausibility of our approach and are discussed in the paper. ? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Natt Och Dag J.; Gervasi V.; Brinkkemper S.; Regnell B.,Speeding up requirements management in a product software company: Linking customer wishes to product requirements through linguistic engineering,2004,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering,38,"Developing large complex software products aimed for a broad market involves a great flow of wishes and requirements. The former are elicited from customers while the latter are brought forth by the developing organization. These are preferably kept separated to preserve the different perspectives. The interrelationships should however be identified and maintained to enable well-founded decisions. Unfortunately, the current manual linkage is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. This paper presents a pragmatic linguistic engineering approach to how statistical natural language processing may be used to support the manual linkage between customer wishes and product requirements by suggesting potential links. An evaluation with real requirements from industry is presented. It shows that in a realistic setting, automatic support could make linkage faster for at least 50% of the links. An estimation based on our evaluation also shows that considerable time savings are possible. The results, together with the identified enhancement, are promising for improving software quality and saving time in industrial requirements engineering. ? 2004 IEEE.",Computer software; Decision making; Linguistics; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Project management; Quality assurance; Societies and institutions; Industrial requirements engineering; Linguistic engineering; Requirements management; Software quality; Requirements engineering,"J.

"Hause M., Thom F.",6.4.1 Creating Flexible Architectures for Systems Engineering,2004,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Systems Engineers have been modeling systems since the inception of the discipline. Reasons for modeling systems include among others: definition of the work to be done (requirements), allocation of responsibilities, documentation of the completed system, and communication with the various disciplines who will create, operate, and maintain the system. UML (the Unified Modeling Language) has recently been used by Systems Engineers to model systems. Many papers and articles have been written on various aspects of systems modeling with UML, most especially Use Cases, but little attention has been paid to system partitioning. Papers that address system partitioning do so with a ?one size fits all? philosophy, by mandating a prescriptive structure that does not address the true needs of a particular system's development. Unfortunately, a badly partitioned system can be a serious handicap to the development of a system. The drivers for system partitioning include: process, product, team makeup, areas of interest, standards, physical boundaries of the system, legacy and COTS components, coupling and cohesion. A proper approach can also help in the establishment of a component based development approach, leading to reuse of requirements, design, test, and implementation artifacts. This paper will discuss these issues and illustrate their use by four case studies drawn from experience in consultation.

Osuna R.V.; Tallinen T.; Lastra J.L.M.; Tuokko R.,Assembly and task planning in a collaborative web-based environment based on assembly process modeling methodology,2003,Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Assembly and Task Planning,2,"Assembly task planning is the generation of the ordered sequence of tasks necessary to assembly the given parts. Based on the Assembly Process Modeling Methodology (APM) developed at the Assembly Automation Laboratory, where the product definition includes both logical and physical building blocks, and the dependencies between them, the development of an Intelligent Task Planning system built upon a Collaborative Web-based environment will enable the integration of the product design process and the assembly system design process. The Product Model definition will consist of a network or hierarchy of interrelated items, where each item has an interface, which contains all the necessary information to verify the item's compliance with the other items in the product definition. The relationships are defined as configuration rules, which can be formally specified in a syntax language. Based on the principle that all intelligent assembly task-planning systems can be structured as a typical knowledge-based system, the use of a software environment that allows the re-use of components, and database independency increases the robustness of the system. The integration of object-oriented and machine learning techniques for intelligent task planning into the system, adds the capability of using complex entities such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) models. The system will serve as an integration point between the product design phase and the assembly system deployment, embracing the capabilities of a web environment, enabling the development team to work remotely over the Internet on one framework, with zero-latency sharing of information.

In addition, even more design solutions, at various levels of abstractions, are created, refined, evaluated, industrialised and verified during this period.

Leveson N.G.; Heimdahl M.P.E.; Reese J.D.,Designing specification languages for process control systems: Lessons learned and steps to the future,1999,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),34,"Previously, we defined a blackbox formal system modeling language called RSML (Requirements State Machine Language). The language was developed over several years while specifying the system requirements for a collision avoidance system for commercial passenger aircraft. During the language development, we received continual feed- back and evaluation by FAA employees and industry representatives, which helped us to produce a specification language that is easily learned and used by application experts. Since the completion of the RSML project, we have continued our re- search on specification languages. This research is part of a larger effort to investigate the more general problem of providing tools to assist in developing embedded systems. Our latest experimental toolset is called SpecTRM (Specification Tools and Requirements Methodology), and the formal specification language is SpecTRM-RL (SpecTRM Requirements Language). This paper describes what we have learned from our use of RSML and how those lessons were applied to the design of SpecTRM-RL. We discuss our goals for SpecTRM-RL and the design features that support each of these goals. ?

"Larsen B., Buede D.",1 A Plug-and-Play Early Validation Module,1999,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"In the complex world of developing requirements and eliciting user needs, engineers build billions of dollars of products that are wrong on delivery, because they solved the wrong problem. All technical people need specialized techniques and processes to increase the probability of developing the right products in the future. Everyone discusses the importance of getting the stakeholder involved, but the present techniques do little to address this problem. Presently, validation is the stakeholder's only mechanism to test that the developer is building the right product. Validation is the process of testing for technical appropriateness and adequacy near the end of the system life cycle process. An Early Validation (EaVa) module will stablize the problem statement, which will enhance the probability of technical appropriateness and adequacy. EaVa can be used continuously, developing requirements, or for the preliminary design phase depending on the system and the stakeholder's needs. EaVa tries to ensure the engineers are solving the right problem prior to the majority of the resources being committed late in the design phase. A critical piece is getting user feedback, based on this EV step, from independent agents or engineers within the process.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

Eberlein A.P.-G.; Halsall F.,Telecommunications service development: A design methodology and its intelligent support,1997,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,6,"This paper describes a development life cycle for telecommunications services, emphasizing requirements capture, formal specification and validation. The service is developed along the three dimensions of the methodology: refinement, completeness and formality, aiming for a complete, consistent and formally specified service definition. The described methodology can be integrated into currently existing development life cycles which employ formal methods for service creation. Active support for the proposed life cycle is provided by a novel expert system called Requirements Assistant for Telecommunications Services (RATS), currently under development. It actively helps during requirements acquisition and early analysis, and encourages specification reuse with the help of a semi-automated negotiation process. The RATS tool advises the service developer during all stages of the service development, and on different levels of abstraction, and provides requirements management facilities, like traceability, impact analysis and document generation. Some of the features are illustrated using examples from the Universal Personal Telecommunication (UPT) service. ? 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

McCay B.,ASSESSING INTEROPERABILITY USING A TOOL'S ARCHITECTURE,1996,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"This paper investigates the usefulness of examining the architecture of a tool to understand its ability to support interoperability. The purpose is to see if such assessments are useful and to suggest next steps. An information system architecture is defined, along with architecture technical performance criteria to help assess interoperability. The architectures of three well-known commercial systems engineering tools (DOORS, RDD-100, and SLATE) are then described. Each architecture is then subjectively scored against the interoperability performance criteria. The paper concludes that this approach is worth further investigation, and offers suggestions regarding refinements for such assessments.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,
Oliver D.,An Analysis of the Model Based Systems Engineering Process,1996,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Much of systems engineering has been performed by writing requirements and specifications primarily in text. An alternative approach preserves the proven best practices of systems engineering, but adds rigorous computer executable models to capture and record the information which describes the system. The requirements and specifications are executable and transformable. Text descriptions are joined to the models so that the proven best practices are not replaced; they are augmented. This paper analyzes the systems engineering process using executable models of behavior and executable models of structure. The structure models are compatible with the traditions of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and modern object-oriented software. A major goal of this work is to provide a convenient separation of the concerns of the systems engineer and to use abstraction to make the sub-processes as simple as possible.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,

The material here draws upon input from the NCOSE tools committee members and published work. The tools automate the systems engineering process. Each kind of tool performs particular functions and captures particular sets of information. In this paper the tools are classified into several categories that are helpful in making tool selections. The classification of tools by how they are used is considered in detail through several layers of decomposition. The tool classes defined by classification by use can be mapped to the systems engineering process to show exactly how the tools are used, what functions they perform what information they capture, and how they interface with one another. That mapping is considered in a companion paper.

"Alessi R., Friedman G., Grady J., Mayhew M., Mayhew K., Rhodes D., Schuster C., Woods T., McCumber W.",5.4.3 THE FOUNDATION OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING,1995,INCOSE International Symposium,\,"Systems Engineering is an existing reality but what is it? Many definitions exist but there seems to be no universally accepted one. Is it a process, a department, or an engineering discipline? From whence did it come and upon what fundamental scientific, mathematical, or logical facts does its foundation rest? The author team intends, over a period of time, to research earlier related work reported upon in National Council on Systems Engineering (NCOSE) publications and other literature, explore these questions in new research, and periodically report progress to NCOSE membership through Symposium papers and presentations and NCOSE Journal papers. This paper begins this process reporting on an intended course of action, identifying the people involved, soliciting the interest of others in pursuing these questions, and offering preliminary results. The initial work reported upon entails identification of a team, its mission, and several theories that will be pursued in research efforts by subteams seeking to support those theories or prove them false. The careful reader will see in this process a merger of the systems approach and the scientific method as a basis for the research project. The several theories are alternative scenarios that will be explored. The final result may be to show that some combination of the theories offers the complete answer supporting the notion that we are inflicted with competing alternative theories at present because we are all looking at specific manifestations of a more general concept than we are presently able to observe and describe. We should be seeking a simpler and more elegant structure that embraces all of our views. We say that we will apply the scientific method but also recognize that this venerated method may be part of the problem inhibiting people from recognizing the critical role that people play in the systems approach. While the team enters this study with the predisposition that systems theory and qualitative and quantitative methodologies offer promise, we will not close our eyes to the possibilities exposed through study of positive and postmodern paradigms. From time to time the team may find it necessary to terminate interest in one theory, merge findings into a grander view, or initiate additional analytical channels.",\,\,Wiley,Conference paper,Wiley,,,,,,1,,
"Black J.E., Jr.",AI Assistance for Requirements Management,1994,Concurrent Engineering,0,"Extraction of requirements from customer specifications has long been a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone manual effort. This is further compounded by the tendency for requirements to be vague and fuzzy things which are difficult to manage. Hypermedia-based, Al-assisted requirements acquisition provides a significant competitive edge over traditional, labor-intensive, error-prone methods. SIR/REX (Systems Information Resource/Requirements EXtractor) provides automation and support to the earliest phases of systems engineering by placing customer specifications into an easily navigated, enriched information resource, and by automatically and consistently extracting candidate requirements and issues from specifications while creating links to the original source documentation. Requirements become tangible objects which can be easily reviewed, adjudicated, and managed by a human being; thus improving productivity and quality in requirements capture. Afterward, when new specifications or new versions of specifications are received, SIR/REX provides an intelligent change manager which facilitates impact analysis and change response while maximizing conservation of existing engineering investment. ? 1994, Sage Publications.

As nodes within the internet of things, they enable networking and thus the automation of complex value-added chains. The application of simulation techniques brings digital twins to life and makes them experimentable; digital twins become experimentable digital twins (EDTs). Initially, these EDTs communicate with each other purely in the virtual world. The resulting networks of interacting EDTs model different application scenarios and are simulated in virtual testbeds, providing new foundations for comprehensive simulation-based systems engineering. Its focus is on EDTs, which become more detailed with every single application. Thus, complete digital representations of the respective real assets and their behaviors are created successively. The networking of EDTs with real assets leads to hybrid application scenarios in which EDTs are used in combination with real hardware, thus realizing complex control algorithms, innovative user interfaces, or mental models for intelligent systems. ? 2005-2012 IEEE.",Analytical models; Complex networks; Industry; Intelligent systems; Mathematical models; Sensors; Testbeds; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Erobotics; Experimentable Digital Twin; Simulation-based X; Solid model; Virtual test beds; Systems engineering,"M.

Analyzing requirements correctly and creating design model sequentially could be critical to the whole process of a product development.

Thus, we proposed an artificial intelligence based framework to deal with textual requirement handling and model creation. With deep learning and natural language process skills, our approach could be able to analyze textual requirements automatically, and then create the related models. This would indeed alleviate the work of engineers and promote the efficiency and quality of product development process.
